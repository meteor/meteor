# Community Packages

The Meteor community is making great efforts to migrate popular packages to Meteor 3.0.

Many packages have been consolidated into the [Meteor Community organization](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages). Others are maintained by individual developers or companies.

A [spreadsheet maintained](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1JbUZmJab3owZ9LV71Ubto32YX_QWQljRypJTOQupxL8/htmlview) by [@harryadel](https://github.com/harryadel) tracks the status of your favorite packages and offers opportunities to help.
