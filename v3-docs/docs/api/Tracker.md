# Tracker

Meteor has a simple dependency tracking system which allows it to
automatically rerun templates and other computations whenever
[`Session`](./session.md) variables, database queries, and other data
sources change.

Unlike most other systems, you don't have to manually declare these
dependencies & it "just works". The mechanism is simple and
efficient. When you call a function that supports reactive updates
(such as a database query), it automatically saves the current
Computation object, if any (representing, for example, the current
template being rendered).  Later, when the data changes, the function
can "invalidate" the Computation, causing it to rerun (rerendering the
template).

Applications will find [`Tracker.autorun`](#Tracker-autorun) useful, while more
advanced facilities such as `Tracker.Dependency` and `onInvalidate`
callbacks are intended primarily for package authors implementing new
reactive data sources.

<ApiBox name="Tracker.autorun" hasCustomExample/>

`Tracker.autorun` allows you to run a function that depends on reactive data
sources, in such a way that if there are changes to the data later,
the function will be rerun.

For example, you can monitor a cursor (which is a reactive data
source) and aggregate it into a session variable:

```js
Tracker.autorun(() => {
  const oldest = _.max(Monkeys.find().fetch(), (monkey) => {
    return monkey.age;
  });

  if (oldest) {
    Session.set('oldest', oldest.name);
  }
});
```

Or you can wait for a session variable to have a certain value, and do
something the first time it does, calling `stop` on the computation to
prevent further rerunning:

```js
Tracker.autorun((computation) => {
  if (!Session.equals('shouldAlert', true)) {
    return;
  }

  computation.stop();
  alert('Oh no!');
});
```

The function is invoked immediately, at which point it may alert and
stop right away if `shouldAlert` is already true.  If not, the
function is run again when `shouldAlert` becomes true.

A change to a data dependency does not cause an immediate rerun, but
rather "invalidates" the computation, causing it to rerun the next
time a flush occurs.  A flush will occur automatically as soon as
the system is idle if there are invalidated computations.  You can
also use [`Tracker.flush`](#Tracker-flush) to cause an immediate flush of
all pending reruns.

If you nest calls to `Tracker.autorun`, then when the outer call stops or
reruns, the inner call will stop automatically.  Subscriptions and
observers are also automatically stopped when used as part of a
computation that is rerun, allowing new ones to be established.  See
[`Meteor.subscribe`](./meteor.md#Meteor-subscribe) for more information about
subscriptions and reactivity.

If the initial run of an autorun throws an exception, the computation
is automatically stopped and won't be rerun.

### Tracker.autorun and async callbacks
`Tracker.autorun` can accept an `async` callback function.
 To preserve reactivity for the reactive variables inside the async callback function, you must use a `Tracker.withComputation`Â call as described below:

<ApiBox name="Tracker.withComputation" />

```javascript
Tracker.autorun(async function example1(computation) {
  // Code before the first await will stay reactive.
  reactiveVar1.get(); // This will trigger a rerun.

  let links = await LinksCollection.findAsync({}).fetch(); // First async call will stay reactive.

  // Code after the first await looses Tracker.currentComputation: no reactivity.
  reactiveVar2.get(); // This won't trigger a rerun.

  // You can bring back reactivity with the Tracker.withCompuation wrapper:
  let users = await Tracker.withComputation(computation, () => Meteor.users.findAsync({}).fetch());

  // Code below will again not be reactive, so you will need another Tracker.withComputation.
  const value = Tracker.withComputation(computation, () => reactiveVar3.get()); // This will trigger a rerun.
});
```

As a rule of thumb, you are okay with wrapping all reactive statements inside a `Tracker.withComputation` to preserve current computation.
But it comes at a performance cost - it should be used only where needed.

Reason behind is, that an await implicitly *"moves"* the code below in a Promise resolved function. When this function runs (after it has been fetched from the micro task queue), `Tracker.withComputation` preserves the reference to the computation of the `Tracker.autorun`.

The `react-meteor-data` package uses `Tracker.withComputation` to make the `useTracker` accept async callbacks.
More can be seen [here](https://github.com/meteor/react-packages/tree/master/packages/react-meteor-data#maintaining-the-reactive-context)

### Using async callbacks in versions of Meteor prior to 2.10
`Tracker.autorun` can accept an `async` callback function.
However, the async call back function will only be dependent on reactive functions called prior to any called functions that return a promise.

Example 1 - autorun `example1()` **is not** dependent on reactive changes to the `Meteor.users` collection.  Because it is dependent on nothing reactive it will run only once:
```javascript
  Tracker.autorun(async function example1() {
    let asyncData = await asyncDataFunction();
    let users = Meteor.users.find({}).fetch();
  });
```

However, simply changing the order so there are no `async` calls prior to the reactive call to `Meteor.users.find`, will make the async autorun `example2()` dependent on reactive changes to the `Meteor.users` collection.

Example 2 -  autorun `example2()` **is** dependent on reactive changes to the Meteor.users collection.  Changes to the `Meteor.users` collection will cause a rerun of `example2()`:
```javascript
  Tracker.autorun(async function example2()  {
    let users = Meteor.users.find({}).fetch();
    let asyncData = await asyncDataFunction();
  });
```
<ApiBox name="Tracker.flush" />

Normally, when you make changes (like writing to the database),
their impact (like updating the DOM) is delayed until the system is
idle. This keeps things predictable &mdash; you can know that the DOM
won't go changing out from under your code as it runs. It's also one
of the things that makes Meteor fast.

`Tracker.flush` forces all of the pending reactive updates to complete.
For example, if an event handler changes a Session
variable that will cause part of the user interface to rerender, the
handler can call `flush` to perform the rerender immediately and then
access the resulting DOM.

An automatic flush occurs whenever the system is idle which performs
exactly the same work as `Tracker.flush`.  The flushing process consists
of rerunning any invalidated computations.  If additional
invalidations happen while flushing, they are processed as part of the
same flush until there is no more work to be done.  Callbacks
registered with [`Tracker.afterFlush`](#Tracker-afterFlush) are called
after processing outstanding invalidations.

It is illegal to call `flush` from inside a `flush` or from a running
computation.

The [Tracker manual](https://github.com/meteor/docs/blob/master/long-form/tracker-manual.md#the-flush-cycle)
describes the motivation for the flush cycle and the guarantees made by
`Tracker.flush` and `Tracker.afterFlush`.

<ApiBox name="Tracker.nonreactive" />

Calls `func` with `Tracker.currentComputation` temporarily set to `null`
and returns `func`'s own return value.  If `func` accesses reactive data
sources, these data sources will never cause a rerun of the enclosing
computation.

<ApiBox name="Tracker.active" />

This value is useful for data source implementations to determine
whether they are being accessed reactively or not.

<ApiBox name="Tracker.inFlush" />

This value indicates, whether a flush is in progress or not.

<ApiBox name="Tracker.currentComputation" />

It's very rare to need to access `currentComputation` directly.  The
current computation is used implicitly by
[`Tracker.active`](#Tracker-active) (which tests whether there is one),
[`dependency.depend()`](#Tracker-Dependency-depend) (which registers that it depends on a
dependency), and [`Tracker.onInvalidate`](#Tracker-onInvalidate) (which
registers a callback with it).

<ApiBox name="Tracker.onInvalidate" />

See [`computation.onInvalidate`](#Tracker-Computation-onInvalidate) for more
details.

<ApiBox name="Tracker.afterFlush" />

Functions scheduled by multiple calls to `afterFlush` are guaranteed
to run in the order that `afterFlush` was called.  Functions are
guaranteed to be called at a time when there are no invalidated
computations that need rerunning.  This means that if an `afterFlush`
function invalidates a computation, that computation will be rerun
before any other `afterFlush` functions are called.


## Tracker.Computation {#tracker_computation}

A Computation object represents code that is repeatedly rerun in
response to reactive data changes.  Computations don't have return
values; they just perform actions, such as rerendering a template on
the screen.  Computations are created using [`Tracker.autorun`](#Tracker-autorun).
Use [`stop`](#Tracker-Computation-stop) to prevent further rerunning of a
computation.

Each time a computation runs, it may access various reactive data
sources that serve as inputs to the computation, which are called its
dependencies.  At some future time, one of these dependencies may
trigger the computation to be rerun by invalidating it.  When this
happens, the dependencies are cleared, and the computation is
scheduled to be rerun at flush time.

The *current computation*
([`Tracker.currentComputation`](#Tracker-currentComputation)) is the
computation that is currently being run or rerun (computed), and the
one that gains a dependency when a reactive data source is accessed.
Data sources are responsible for tracking these dependencies using
[`Tracker.Dependency`](#Tracker-Dependency) objects.

Invalidating a computation sets its `invalidated` property to true
and immediately calls all of the computation's `onInvalidate`
callbacks.  When a flush occurs, if the computation has been invalidated
and not stopped, then the computation is rerun by setting the
`invalidated` property to `false` and calling the original function
that was passed to `Tracker.autorun`.  A flush will occur when the current
code finishes running, or sooner if `Tracker.flush` is called.

Stopping a computation invalidates it (if it is valid) for the purpose
of calling callbacks, but ensures that it will never be rerun.

Example:

```js
// If we're in a computation, then perform some clean-up when the current
// computation is invalidated (rerun or stopped).
if (Tracker.active) {
  Tracker.onInvalidate(() => {
    x.destroy();
    y.finalize();
  });
}
```

<ApiBox name="Tracker.Computation#stop" instanceName="computation"/>

Stopping a computation is irreversible and guarantees that it will
never be rerun.  You can stop a computation at any time, including
from the computation's own run function.  Stopping a computation that
is already stopped has no effect.

Stopping a computation causes its `onInvalidate` callbacks to run
immediately if it is not currently invalidated, as well as its
`stop` callbacks.

Nested computations are stopped automatically when their enclosing
computation is rerun.

<ApiBox name="Tracker.Computation#invalidate"instanceName="computation" />

Invalidating a computation marks it to be rerun at
[flush time](#Tracker-flush), at
which point the computation becomes valid again.  It is rare to
invalidate a computation manually, because reactive data sources
invalidate their calling computations when they change.  Reactive data
sources in turn perform this invalidation using one or more
[`Tracker.Dependency`](#Tracker-Dependency) objects.

Invalidating a computation immediately calls all `onInvalidate`
callbacks registered on it.  Invalidating a computation that is
currently invalidated or is stopped has no effect.  A computation can
invalidate itself, but if it continues to do so indefinitely, the
result will be an infinite loop.

<ApiBox name="Tracker.Computation#onInvalidate" instanceName="computation" />

`onInvalidate` registers a one-time callback that either fires
immediately or as soon as the computation is next invalidated or
stopped.  It is used by reactive data sources to clean up resources or
break dependencies when a computation is rerun or stopped.

To get a callback after a computation has been recomputed, you can
call [`Tracker.afterFlush`](#Tracker-afterFlush) from `onInvalidate`.

<ApiBox name="Tracker.Computation#onStop" instanceName="computation"/>

<ApiBox name="Tracker.Computation#stopped" instanceName="computation"/>

<ApiBox name="Tracker.Computation#invalidated"instanceName="computation"/>

This property is initially false.  It is set to true by `stop()` and
`invalidate()`.  It is reset to false when the computation is
recomputed at flush time.

<ApiBox name="Tracker.Computation#firstRun" instanceName="computation"/>

This property is a convenience to support the common pattern where a
computation has logic specific to the first run.

<ApiBox name="Tracker.Computation#firstRunPromise" instanceName="computation" />

`Computation.firstRunPromise` will be set to the result of the call of the autorun function after the initial computation has been completed. If the autorun function is an async function, it'll then contain its promise, thus making the completion of the execution await-able. That allows us to manually synchronize autoruns like this:

```js

await Tracker.autorun(async () => {
  await Meteor.userAsync();
  (...more async code...)
}).firstRunPromise;

await Tracker.autorun(async () => {
  await asyncSomeOrOther();
  (...more async code...)
}).firstRunPromise;

```

For a better developer experience `firstRunPromise` is automatically appended to your async `autorun` calls so you don't have to write them yourself. Meaning this also works:

```js

await Tracker.autorun(async () => {
  await Meteor.userAsync();
  (...more async code...)
});

await Tracker.autorun(async () => {
  await asyncSomeOrOther();
  (...more async code...)
});

```


## Tracker.Dependency {#Tracker-Dependency}

A Dependency represents an atomic unit of reactive data that a
computation might depend on.  Reactive data sources such as Session or
Minimongo internally create different Dependency objects for different
pieces of data, each of which may be depended on by multiple
computations.  When the data changes, the computations are
invalidated.

Dependencies don't store data, they just track the set of computations to
invalidate if something changes.  Typically, a data value will be
accompanied by a Dependency object that tracks the computations that depend
on it, as in this example:

```js
let weather = 'sunny';
const weatherDep = new Tracker.Dependency();

function getWeather() {
  weatherDep.depend();
  return weather;
}

function setWeather(newWeather) {
  weather = newWeather;

  // Note: We could add logic here to only call `changed` if the new value is
  // different from the old value.
  weatherDep.changed();
}
```

This example implements a weather data source with a simple getter and
setter.  The getter records that the current computation depends on
the `weatherDep` dependency using `depend()`, while the setter
signals the dependency to invalidate all dependent computations by
calling `changed()`.

The reason Dependencies do not store data themselves is that it can be
useful to associate multiple Dependencies with the same piece of data.
For example, one Dependency might represent the result of a database
query, while another might represent just the number of documents in
the result.  A Dependency could represent whether the weather is sunny
or not, or whether the temperature is above freezing.
[`Session.equals`](./session.md#Session-equals) is implemented this way for
efficiency.  When you call `Session.equals('weather', 'sunny')`, the
current computation is made to depend on an internal Dependency that
does not change if the weather goes from, say, `rainy` to `cloudy`.

Conceptually, the only two things a Dependency can do are gain a
dependent and change.

A Dependency's dependent computations are always valid (they have
`invalidated === false`).  If a dependent is invalidated at any time,
either by the Dependency itself or some other way, it is immediately
removed.

See the [Tracker manual](https://github.com/meteor/docs/blob/master/long-form/tracker-manual.md#creating-a-reactive-value-using-trackerdependency)
to learn how to create a reactive data source using `Tracker.Dependency`.

<ApiBox name="Tracker.Dependency#changed" instanceName="dependency"/>

<ApiBox name="Tracker.Dependency#depend" instanceName="dependency"/>

`dependency.depend()` is used in reactive data source implementations to record
the fact that `dependency` is being accessed from the current computation.

<ApiBox name="Tracker.Dependency#hasDependents" instanceName="dependency"/>

For reactive data sources that create many internal Dependencies,
this function is useful to determine whether a particular Dependency is
still tracking any dependency relationships or if it can be cleaned up
to save memory.
