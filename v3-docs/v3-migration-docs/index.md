# Meteor 3.0 Migration Guide

:::info You are reading the migration guide for Meteor 3!

This is a live document which will be updated as development progresses.
:::

This guide is for users with Meteor 2.x projects understand the changes between Meteor 2.x and Meteor 3.0. It's not required to read this guide before starting with Meteor 3.0. To learn Meteor 3.0, we recommend reading the [new documentation](https://v3-docs.meteor.com).

## What's the status of version 3.0?

Meteor 3.0 is currently in its official version!

**Latest version:** `3.0.3` <br/>
**Node.js version:** `20.17.0 LTS` <br/>
**NPM version:** `10.8.2`

## How to try Meteor 3.0?

You can create a new Meteor 3.0 project by running the command below:

```bash
meteor create my-new-project --release 3.0.3
```

## How to upgrade from Meteor 2.x?

You can upgrade your Meteor 2.x project by running the command below inside your project folder:

```bash
meteor update --release 3.0.3
meteor reset # resets project to a fresh state
```

If you are upgrade from an older version of Meteor, you might have a different MongoDB driver version. If you encounter issues, consider clearing the local database.

```bash
meteor reset --db # resets local db
```

Also, it's a good idea to completely remove `node_modules` and the `package-lock.json` before running `meteor npm install`:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
meteor npm install
```

Which will install the necessary packages using the latest Node.js version from Meteor 3.

## Migrating with codemods

To streamline the upgrade process, we have collaborated with the [Codemod](https://github.com/codemod-com/codemod) team to automate many migration steps with [open-source codemods](https://go.codemod.com/meteor-v3).

You can run all Meteor v3 codemods using the [following migration recipe](https://go.codemod.com/meteor-3-recipe):

```bash
npx codemod@latest meteor/v3/migration-recipe
```

This recipe will run all the following codemods in consequetive order:

- [`meteor/v3/add-await-to-async-webapp-methods`](https://go.codemod.com/meteor-update-webapp-methods)
- [`meteor/v3/api-rename-express-migration`](https://go.codemod.com/meteor-express-api-rename)
- [`meteor/v3/call-async`](https://go.codemod.com/meteor-call-async)
- [`meteor/v3/user-async`](https://go.codemod.com/meteor-user-async)
- [`meteor/v3/fibers-to-async-promises`](https://go.codemod.com/meteor-fibers-async)
- [`meteor/v3/removed-functions`](https://go.codemod.com/meteor-removed-functions)
- [`meteor/v3/renamed-functions`](https://go.codemod.com/meteor-renamed-functions)
- [`meteor/v3/mongo-db-async-methods`](https://go.codemod.com/meteor-mongo-async)

Throughout this migration guide, you will find tips and instructions on using the individual codemods that address specific breaking changes.
