# Vite Bundler with Meteor 3

For Meteor 3 you need to use the beta version of `jorgenvatle:vite-bundler` package to use Vite as the bundler for your Meteor project:

```bash
meteor add jorgenvatle:vite-bundler@2.0.0-beta.12
```

Also, you need to install Vite as a dev dependency in your project:

```bash
meteor npm i -D vite@4
meteor npm i meteor-vite
```

For the remaining steps you can follow the package guide located [here](https://github.com/JorgenVatle/meteor-vite). There you can also find starter templates for different front-end frameworks.
