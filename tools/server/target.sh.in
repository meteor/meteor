# If there are global node_modules in the bundle, remove them, since

# bundle' historically embeds them to give you a self-contained
# bundle. But that never worked very well, because you'd get the
# version for the arch you built on, and you'd have to manually
# rebuild the binary modules (node-fibers) on the target system. It is
# not ideal to have the bundle modify itself (much better for it to be
# immutable) but ti'll do for now.
