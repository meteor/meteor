// Watch for changes to a set of files, and the first time that any of
// the files change, call a user-provided callback. (If you want a
// second callback, you'll need to create a second Watcher.)
//
// You can set up two kinds of watches, file and directory watches.
//
// In a file watch, you provide an absolute path to a file and a SHA1
// (encoded as hex) of the contents of that file. If the file ever
// changes so that its contents no longer match that SHA1, the
// callback triggers.
//
// In a directory watch, you provide an absolute path to a directory
// and two lists of regular expressions specifying the files to
// include or exclude. If there is ever a file in the directory or its
// children that matches the criteria set up by the regular
// expressions, but that IS NOT present as a file watch, then the
// callback triggers.
//
// For directory watches, the regular expressions work as follows. You
// provide two arrays of regular expressions, an include list and an
// exclude list. A file in the directory matches if it matches at
// least one regular expression in the include list, and doesn't match
// any regular expressions in the exclude list. Subdirectories are
// included recursively, as long as their names do not match any
// regular expression in the exclude list.
//
// When multiple directory watches are set up, say on a directory A
// and its subdirectory B, the most specific watch takes precedence in
// each directory. So only B's include/exclude lists will be checked
// in B.
//
// Regular expressions are checked only against individual path
// components (the actual name of the file or the subdirectory), not
// against the entire path.
//
// You can call stop() to stop watching and tear down the
// watcher. Calling stop() guarantees that you will not receive a
// callback (if you have not already.) Calling stop() is unnecessary
// if you've received a callback.
//
// A limitation of the current implementation is that if you set up a
// directory watch on a directory A, and A does not exist at the time
// the Watcher is created but is then created later, then A will not
// be monitored. (Of course, this limitation only applies to the roots
// of the directory watches. If A exists at the time the watch is
// created, and a subdirectory B is later created, it will be properly
// detected. Likewise if A exists and is then deleted it will be
// detected.)
//
// To do a "one-shot" (to see if any files have been modified,
// compared to the dependencies, at a particular point in time, just
// create a Watcher and see if your onChange function was called
// before the Watcher constructor changed. (Then call stop() as
// usual.)
//
// XXX This should be reengineered so that dependency information from
// multiple sources can be easily merged in a generic way. Possibly in
// this new model subdirectories would be allowed in include/exclude
// patterns, and multiple directory rules would be OR'd rather than
// taking the most specific rule.

// - files: see self.files comment below
// - directories: see self.directories comment below
// - onChange: the function to call when the first change is detected.
