// Wrapper to manage a connection to a DDP service. The main difference between
// it and a raw DDP connection is that the constructor blocks until a successful
// connection is made; you can't call methods or subscribe asynchronously (ie,
// there's always a wait); and if the connection disconnects (with or without
// error) while we're waiting on a method call or subscription, the
// apply/subscribeAndWait call throws the given error. This functionality should
// eventually end up in the DDP client in one form or another.
//
// ServiceConnections never reconnect once they have successfully negotiated the
// DDP protocol: other than perhaps some initial attempts with the wrong
// protocol selected, they use just one underlying TCP connection, and fail
// fast.
//
// - endpointUrl: the url to connect to

//   ...and anything else you'd normally pass as options to DDP.connect
