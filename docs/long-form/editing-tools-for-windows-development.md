While working on the Windows port of Meteor, we came across a few simple tools that made programming on Windows more enjoyable for us. They might be particularly helpful to people coming from a Mac or Linux background where command-line development is more common.

## ConEmu

This is a tool that makes using CMD and PowerShell more enjoyable by allowing you to have tabs, easily copy and paste into and out of the window, configure key bindings, set a nicer font, and lots of other nice features.

## Notepad++

Notepad++ is a free text editor for Windows that improves in every single way over its namesake Notepad. It's great for editing any kind of code.

## Sublime Text

Sublime Text is a nice text editor that gets out of your way at the right times and has lots of nice plugins for JavaScript programming. It's not free, but has an unlimited trial period.

## Version Control

You might find it useful to use Git or a different version control system to collaborate on your projects. The simplest ones that we found for Windows are [msysgit](https://msysgit.github.io/), which is used from the command line, and [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/), which has a GUI but only supports GitHub.
