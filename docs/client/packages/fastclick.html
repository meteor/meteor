## `fastclick`

The FastClick package is automatically included in Meteor Cordova/PhoneGap
apps to ensure the best user experience.

From the [README on GitHub](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick):

"FastClick is a simple, easy-to-use library for eliminating the 300ms delay
between a physical tap and the firing of a click event on mobile browsers.
The aim is to make your application feel less laggy and more responsive while
avoiding any interference with your current logic."

In case you want to disable FastClick for certain elements, you can add the
"needsclick" class as described in the [advanced section](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick#ignore-certain-elements-with-needsclick)
of the FastClick documentation:

```html
<a class="needsclick">Ignored by FastClick</a>
```
