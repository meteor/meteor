## `less`

[LESS](http://lesscss.org/) extends CSS with dynamic behavior such as variables, mixins,
operations and functions. It allows for more compact stylesheets and
helps reduce code duplication in CSS files.

With the `less` package installed, `.less` files in your application are
automatically compiled to CSS and the results are included in the client CSS
bundle.

{{#note}}
If you want to `@import` a file, give it the extension `.import.less`
to prevent Meteor from processing it independently.
