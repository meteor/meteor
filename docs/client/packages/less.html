## `less`

LESS extends CSS with dynamic behavior such as variables, mixins,
operations and functions. It allows for more compact stylesheets and
helps reduce code duplication in CSS files.

With the `less` package installed, `.less` files in your application are
automatically compiled to CSS and the results are included in the client
CSS bundle.

See <http://lesscss.org/> for documentation of the LESS language.
