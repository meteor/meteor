## `absolute-url`

This package allows constructing absolute URLs pointing back to the
application. The server reads from the `ROOT_URL` environment variable
to determine where it is running. This is taken care of automatically
for apps deployed with `meteor deploy`, but must be provided when using
`meteor bundle`.
