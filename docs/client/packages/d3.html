## `d3`

[D3.js](http://d3js.org/) is a JavaScript library for manipulating
documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG
and CSS. D3's emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities
of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework,
combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach
to DOM manipulation.

The `d3` package adds the D3 library to the client JavaScript
bundle. It has no effect on the server.
