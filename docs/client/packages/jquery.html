## `jquery`

[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is a fast and concise JavaScript
Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling,
animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development.

The `jquery` package adds the jQuery library to the client JavaScript
bundle. It has no effect on the server.

In addition to the `jquery` package, Meteor provides several jQuery
plugins as separate packages. These include:

* [`jquery-history`](https://github.com/balupton/history.js)
* [`jquery-layout`](http://layout.jquery-dev.net/)
* [`jquery-waypoints`](http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/)
