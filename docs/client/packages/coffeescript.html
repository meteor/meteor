## `coffeescript`

CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript. It
provides a simple syntax without lots of braces and parentheses.  The
code compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no
interpretation at runtime.

CoffeeScript is supported on both the client and the server. Files
ending with `.coffee` are automatically compiled to JavaScript.
