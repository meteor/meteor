## `coffeescript`

[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) is a little language that
compiles into JavaScript. It provides a simple syntax without lots of
braces and parentheses.  The code compiles one-to-one into the
equivalent JS, and there is no interpretation at runtime.

CoffeeScript is supported on both the client and the server. Files
ending with `.coffee` or `.litcoffee` are automatically compiled to
JavaScript.
