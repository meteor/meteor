## `coffeescript`

[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) is a little language that
compiles into JavaScript. It provides a simple syntax without lots of
braces and parentheses.  The code compiles one-to-one into the
equivalent JS, and there is no interpretation at runtime.

CoffeeScript is supported on both the client and the server. Files
ending with `.coffee` or `.litcoffee` are automatically compiled to
JavaScript.

Global variables can be set in CoffeeScript by using `this` (or CoffeeScript's
`@` shorthand), because at the top level `this` refers to the global namespace
(`window` on the client and
[`global`](http://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_global) on the server).
Thus

    @myFunction = -> 123

at the top level sets the global variable `myFunction`.
