## `amplify`

Amplify provides a simple cross-browser API for HTML5 local storage, an
in-browser communication channel for loosely coupling application
components, and several useful utility functions.

Amplify defines a global namespace `amplify` on the client only. It does
not run on the server.

For more information about Amplify, see <http://amplifyjs.com/>.
