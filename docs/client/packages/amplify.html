## `amplify`

[Amplify](http://amplifyjs.com/) provides a simple cross-browser API for HTML5 local storage, an
in-browser communication channel for loosely coupling application
components, and several useful utility functions.

Amplify defines a global namespace `amplify` on the client only. It does
not run on the server.
