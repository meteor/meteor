## `appcache`

The `appcache` package is an experimental package to enable the
browser's application cache, which allows the static portion of a
Meteor application (the client side Javascript, HTML, CSS, and images)
to run offline.

The `appcache` package by itself however does not provide a mechanism
for offline *data*: if an application starts up offline, a
`Meteor.Collection` on the client will be empty... until such time the
browser connects to the Internet and Meteor is able to establish its
online livedata connection.

This package should not be used on a domain if there's a chance you
might want to revert to using Meteor 0.5.4 or older on that domain.
(Older versions of Meteor do not tell the browser to turn off the app
cache, which means that users who have your application cached would
be stuck running your old code even if you aren't using the `appcache`
package any more).  Meteor >= 0.5.5 does not have this problem: the
browser will revert to not using the app cache if you remove the
`appcache` package.

For more information about the `AppCache` package see the
[AppCache](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/AppCache)
page in the Meteor wiki.
