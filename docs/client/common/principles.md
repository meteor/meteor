<h2 id="sevenprinciples">Principles of Meteor</h2>

- _Data on the Wire_. Meteor doesn't send HTML over the network. The server sends data and
lets the client render it.

- _One Language._ Meteor lets you write both the client and the server parts of your
application in JavaScript.

- _Database Everywhere_. You can use the same methods to access your
database from the client or the server.

- _Latency Compensation_. On the client, Meteor prefetches data and simulates models to make it look like server method calls return instantly.

- _Full Stack Reactivity_. In Meteor, realtime is the default. All layers, from
database to template, update themselves automatically when necessary.

- _Embrace the Ecosystem_. Meteor is open source and integrates with existing open source tools and frameworks.

- _Simplicity Equals Productivity_. The best way to make something
seem simple is to have it actually _be_ simple. Meteor's main functionality has
clean, classically beautiful APIs.
