<h2 id="collections"><span>Collections</span></h2>

Meteor stores data in *collections*. JavaScript objects stored in collections
are called `documents`.  To get started, declare a collection with
`new Mongo.Collection`.

{{> autoApiBox name="Mongo.Collection" options=""}}

Calling the `Mongo.Collection` constructor creates a collection object
which acts just like a MongoDB collection. If you pass a name when you
create the collection, then you are declaring a persistent collection
&mdash; one that is stored on the server and can be published to clients.

To allow both client code and server code to access the same collection
using the same API, it's usually best to declare collections as global
variables in a JavaScript file that's present on both client and server.

Here's an example of declaring two named, persistent collections as global
variables:

```
// In a JS file that's loaded on the client and the server
Posts = new Mongo.Collection("posts");
Comments = new Mongo.Collection("comments");
```

If you pass `null` as the name, then you're creating a local
collection. Local collections are not synchronized between the client and
the server; they are just temporary collections of JavaScript objects that
support Mongo-style `find`, `insert`, `update`, and `remove` operations.

By default, Meteor automatically publishes every document in your
collection to each connected client. To disable this behavior, you must
remove the `autopublish` package, in your terminal:

```
meteor remove autopublish
```

Then, use [`Meteor.publish`](#meteor_publish) and
[`Meteor.subscribe`](#meteor_subscribe) to specify which parts of your
collection should be published to which clients.

Use `findOne` or `find` to retrieve documents from a collection.

{{> autoApiBox name="Mongo.Collection#findOne" options="sort;skip;fields"}}

This method lets you retrieve a specific document from your
collection. The `findOne` method is most commonly called with a specific
document `_id`:

```
var post = Posts.findOne(postId);
```

However, you can also call `findOne` with a Mongo selector, which is an
object that specifies a required set of attributes of the desired
document. For example, this selector

```
var post = Posts.findOne({
  createdBy: "12345",
  title: {$regex: /first/}
});
```

will match this document

```
{
  createdBy: "12345",
  title: "My first post!",
  content: "Today was a good day."
}
```

You can read about MongoDB query operators such as `$regex`, `$lt` (less than),
`$text` (text search), and more in the [MongoDB
documentation](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/query/).

One useful behavior that might not be obvious is that Mongo selectors also
match items in arrays. For example, this selector

```
Post.findOne({
  tags: "meteor"
});
```

will match this document

```
{
  title: "I love Meteor",
  createdBy: "242135223",
  tags: ["meteor", "javascript", "fun"]
}
```

The `findOne` method is reactive just like [`Session.get`](#session_get),
meaning that, if you use it inside a [template helper](#template_helpers)
or a [`Tracker.autorun`](#tracker_autorun) callback, it will automatically
rerender the view or rerun the computation if the returned document
changes.

Note that `findOne` will return `null` if it fails to find a matching document,
which often happens if the document hasn't been loaded yet or has been removed
from the collection, so you should be prepared to handle `null` values.

{{> autoApiBox name="Mongo.Collection#find" options="sort;skip;limit;fields"}}

The `find` method is similar to `findOne`, but instead of returning a
single document it returns a MongoDB *cursor*. A cursor is a special
object that represents a list of documents that might be returned from a
query. You can pass a cursor into a template helper anywhere you could
pass an array:

```
Template.blog.helpers({
  posts: function () {
    // this helper returns a cursor of
    // all of the posts in the collection
    return Posts.find();
  }
});
```

```
<!-- a template that renders multiple posts -->
<template name="blog">
  {{dstache}}#each posts}}
    <h1>{{dstache}}title}}</h1>
    <p>{{dstache}}content}}</p>
  {{dstache}}/each}}
</template>
```

When you want to retrieve the current list of documents from a cursor,
call the cursor's `.fetch()` method:

```
// get an array of posts
var postsArray = Posts.find().fetch();
```

Keep in mind that while the computation in which you call `fetch` will rerun
when the data changes, the resulting array will not be reactive if it is
passed somewhere else.

You can modify the data stored in a `Mongo.Collection` by calling `insert`,
`update`, or `remove`.

{{> autoApiBox "Mongo.Collection#insert"}}

Here's how you insert a document into a collection:

```
Posts.insert({
  createdBy: Meteor.userId(),
  createdAt: new Date(),
  title: "My first post!",
  content: "Today was a good day."
});
```

Every document in every `Mongo.Collection` has an `_id` field. It must be
unique, and is automatically generated if you don't provide one. The `_id`
field can be used to retrieve a specific document using
[`collection.findOne`](#findOne).

{{> autoApiBox "Mongo.Collection#update"}}

The selector here is just like the one you would pass to `find`, and can
match multiple documents. The modifier is an object that specifies which
changes should be made to the matched documents. Watch out - unless you use
an operator like `$set`, `update` will simply replace the entire matched
document with the modifier.

Here's an example of setting the `content` field on all posts whose titles
contain the word "first":

```
Posts.update({
  title: {$regex: /first/}
}, {
  $set: {content: "Tomorrow will be a great day."}
});
```

You can read about all of the different operators that are supported in the
[MongoDB documentation](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/update/).

There's one catch: when you call `update` on the client, you can only find
documents by their `_id` field. To use all of the possible selectors, you
must call `update` in server code or from a [method](#meteor_methods).

{{> autoApiBox "Mongo.Collection#remove"}}

This method uses the same selectors as `find` and `update`, and removes
any documents that match the selector from the database. Use `remove`
carefully &mdash; there's no way to get that data back.

As with `update`, client code can only remove documents by `_id`, whereas
server code and [methods](#meteor_methods) can remove documents using any
selector.


{{> autoApiBox name="Mongo.Collection#allow" options="insert, update, remove"}}

In newly created apps, Meteor allows almost any calls to `insert`, `update`, and
`remove` from any client or server code. This is because apps started with
`meteor create` include the `insecure` package by default to simplify
development. Obviously, if any user could change the database whenever they
wanted it would be bad for security, so it is important to remove the
`insecure` package and specify some permissions rules, in your terminal:

```
meteor remove insecure
```

Once you have removed the `insecure` package, use the `allow` and `deny`
methods to control who can perform which operations on the database. By
default, all operations on the client are denied, so we need to add some
`allow` rules.  Keep in mind that server code and code inside
[methods](#meteor_methods) are not affected by `allow` and `deny` &mdash;
these rules only apply when `insert`, `update`, and `remove` are called
from untrusted client code.

For example, we might say that users can only create new posts if the
`createdBy` field matches the ID of the current user, so that users can't
impersonate each other.

```
// In a file loaded on the server (ignored on the client)
Posts.allow({
  insert: function (userId, post) {
    // can only create posts where you are the author
    return post.createdBy === userId;
  },
  remove: function (userId, post) {
    // can only delete your own posts
    return post.createdBy === userId;
  }
  // since there is no update field, all updates
  // are automatically denied
});
```

The `allow` method accepts three possible callbacks: `insert`, `remove`,
and `update`. The first argument to all three callbacks is the `_id` of
the logged in user, and the remaining arguments are as follows:

1. `insert(userId, document)`

    `document` is the document that is about to be inserted into the database.
    Return `true` if the insert should be allowed, `false` otherwise.

2. `update(userId, document, fieldNames, modifier)`

    `document` is the document that is about to be modified. `fieldNames` is an
    array of top-level fields that are affected by this change. `modifier` is
    the [Mongo Modifier](#mongo_modifiers) that was passed as the second
    argument of `collection.update`. It can be difficult to achieve correct
    validation using this callback, so it is recommended to use
    [methods](#meteor_methods) instead. Return `true` if the update should be
    allowed, `false` otherwise.

3. `remove(userId, document)`

    `document` is the document that is about to be removed from the database.
    Return `true` if the document should be removed, `false` otherwise.


{{> autoApiBox name="Mongo.Collection#deny" options="insert, update, remove"}}

The `deny` method lets you selectively override your `allow` rules. While
only one of your `allow` callbacks has to return true to allow a
modification, _every one_ of your `deny` callbacks has to return false for
the database change to happen.

For example, if we wanted to override part of our `allow` rule above to exclude
certain post titles:

```
// In a file loaded on the server (ignored on the client)
Posts.deny({
  insert: function (userId, post) {
    // Don't allow posts with a certain title
    return post.title === "First!";
  }
});
```
