<h2 id="structuringyourapp">Structuring your application</h2>

A Meteor application is a mix of client-side JavaScript that runs inside a web
browser or PhoneGap mobile app, server-side JavaScript that runs on the Meteor
server inside a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) container, and all the supporting
HTML templates, CSS rules, and static assets.  Meteor automates the packaging
and transmission of these different components, and it is quite flexible about
how you choose to structure those components in your file tree.

### Special Directories

By default, any JavaScript files in your Meteor folder are bundled and sent to
the client and the server. However, the names of the files and directories
inside your project can affect their load order, where they are loaded, and some
other characteristics. Here is a list of file and directory names that are
treated specially by Meteor:

- **client**

    Any directory named `client` is not loaded on the server. Similar to
    wrapping your code in `if (Meteor.isClient) { ... }`. All files loaded on
    the client are automatically concatenated and minified when in production
    mode. In development mode, JavaScript and CSS files are not minified, to
    make debugging easier.  (CSS files are still combined into a single file
    for consistency between production and development, because changing the
    CSS file's URL affects how URLs in it are processed.)


    HTML files in a Meteor application are treated quite a bit differently
    from a server-side framework.  Meteor scans all the HTML files in your
    directory for three top-level elements: `<head>`, `<body>`, and
    `<template>`.  The head and body sections are separately concatenated
    into a single head and body, which are transmitted to the client on
    initial page load.

- **server**

    Any directory named `server` is not loaded on the client. Similar to
    wrapping your code in `if (Meteor.isServer) { ... }`, except the client
    never even receives the code. Any sensitive code that you don't want served
    to the client, such as code containing passwords or authentication
    mechanisms, should be kept in the `server` directory.

    Meteor gathers all your JavaScript files, excluding anything under the
    `client`, `public`, and `private` subdirectories, and loads them into a
    Node.js server instance.  In Meteor, your server code runs in a single
    thread per request, not in the asynchronous callback style typical of Node.
    We find the linear execution model a better fit for the typical server code
    in a Meteor application.

- **public**

    All files inside a top-level directory called `public` are served as-is to
    the client. When referencing these assets, do not include `public/` in the
    URL, write the URL as if they were all in the top level. For example,
    reference `public/bg.png` as `<img src='/bg.png' />`. This is the best place
    for `favicon.ico`, `robots.txt`, and similar files.

- **private**

    All files inside a top-level directory called `private` are only accessible
    from server code and can be loaded via the [`Assets`](#assets) API. This can
    be used for private data files and any files that are in your project
    directory that you don't want to be accessible from the outside.

- **client/compatibility**

    This folder is for compatibility JavaScript libraries that rely on variables
    declared with var at the top level being exported as globals.  Files in this
    directory are executed without being wrapped in a new variable scope.  These
    files are executed before other client-side JavaScript files.

- **tests**

    Any directory named `tests` is not loaded anywhere. Use this for any local
    test code.

- **node_modules**

    For compatibility with node.js tools used alongside Meteor, any directory named
    `node_modules` is not loaded anywhere. node.js packages installed into
    `node_modules` directories will not be available to your Meteor code. Use
    `Npm.depends` in your package `package.js` file for that.

The following directories are also not loaded as part of your app code:

- Files/directories whose names start with a dot, like `.meteor` and `.git`
- `packages/`: Used for local packages, covered below
- `programs`: For legacy reasons
- [`cordova-build-override`](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Meteor-Cordova-Phonegap-integration#advanced-build-customization)

### Files outside special directories

All JavaScript files outside special directories are loaded on both the client
and the server.  That's the place for model definitions and other functions.
Meteor provides the variables [`Meteor.isClient`](#meteor_isclient) and
[`Meteor.isServer`](#meteor_isserver) so that your code can alter its behavior
depending on whether it's running on the client or the server.

CSS and HTML files outside special directories are loaded on the client only,
and cannot be used from server code.

### Example File Structure

The file structure of your Meteor app is very flexible. Here is an example layout that takes advantage of some of the special folders mentioned above.

```bash
lib/                      # common code like collections and utilities
lib/methods.js            # Meteor.methods definitions
lib/constants.js          # constants used in the rest of the code

client/compatibility      # legacy libraries that expect to be global
client/lib/               # code for the client to be loaded first
client/lib/helpers.js     # useful helpers for your client code
client/body.html          # content that goes in the <body> of your HTML
client/head.html          # content for <head> of your HTML: <meta> tags, etc
client/style.css          # some CSS code
client/<feature>.html     # HTML templates related to a certain feature
client/<feature>.js       # JavaScript code related to a certain feature

server/lib/permissions.js # sensitive permissions code used by your server
server/publications.js    # Meteor.publish definitions

public/favicon.ico        # app icon

settings.json             # configuration data to be passed to meteor --settings
mobile-config.js          # define icons and metadata for Android/iOS
```

You can also model your directory structure after the example apps. Run `meteor
create --example todos` and explore the directories to see where all the files
in a real app could go.

### File Load Order

It is best to write your application in such a way that it is insensitive to
the order in which files are loaded, for example by using [Meteor.startup](#meteor_startup),
or by moving load order sensitive code into [packages](#usingpackages),
which can explicitly control both the load order of their contents and their
load order with respect to other packages. However, sometimes load order
dependencies in your application are unavoidable.

There are several load ordering rules. They are *applied sequentially* to all
applicable files in the application, in the priority given below:

1. HTML template files are *always* loaded before everything else
2. Files beginning with `main.` are loaded last
3. Files inside *any* `lib/` directory are loaded next
4. Files with deeper paths are loaded next
5. Files are then loaded in alphabetical order of the entire path

```js
nav.html
main.html
client/lib/methods.js
client/lib/styles.js
lib/feature/styles.js
lib/collections.js
client/feature-y.js
feature-x.js
client/main.js
```

For example, the files above are arranged in the correct load order.
`main.html` is loaded second because HTML templates are always loaded first,
even if it begins with `main.`, since rule 1 has priority over rule 2.
However, it will be loaded after `nav.html` because rule 2 has priority over
rule 5.

`client/lib/styles.js` and `lib/feature/styles.js` have identical load order
up to rule 4; however, since `client` comes before `lib` alphabetically,
it will be loaded first.

### Organizing Your Project

There are three main ways to organize your files into features or components.
Let's say we have two types of objects in our project: **apples** and
**oranges**.

#### Method 1: Root-Level Folders

Since the special `client`, `server`, and `lib` directories work if they are
anywhere in the path, you can use top-level folders to organize code into
modules:

```bash
apples/lib/               # code for apple-related features
apples/client/
apples/server/

oranges/lib/              # code for orange-related features
oranges/client/
oranges/server/
```

#### Method 2: Folders inside client/ and server/

```bash
lib/apples/               # common code for apples
lib/oranges/              # and oranges

client/apples/            # client code for apples
client/oranges/           # and oranges

server/apples/            # server code for apples
server/oranges/           # and oranges
```

#### Method 3: Packages

This is the ultimate in code separation, modularity, and reusability. If you put
the code for each feature in a separate package, the code for one feature won't
be able to access the code for the other feature except through exports, making
every dependency explicit. This also allows for the easiest independent testing
of features. You can also publish the packages and use them in multiple apps
with `meteor add`.

```bash
packages/apples/package.js     # files, dependencies, exports for apple feature
packages/apples/<anything>.js  # file loading is controlled by package.js

packages/oranges/package.js    # files, dependencies, exports for orange feature
packages/oranges/<anything>.js # file loading is controlled by package.js
```

To read about best practices for managing data and security in Meteor, consult the Meteor Guide:

- [Security](http://guide.meteor.com/security.html)
- [Database collections](http://guide.meteor.com/collections.html)
- [Data loading](http://guide.meteor.com/data-loading.html)
- [Methods and saving data](http://guide.meteor.com/methods.html)

<h3 id="dataandsecurity-authentication">Authentication and user accounts</h3>

Meteor includes [Meteor Accounts](#accounts_api), a state-of-the-art
authentication system. It features secure password login using the
[bcrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) algorithm,
and integration with external services including Facebook, GitHub,
Google, Meetup, Twitter, and Weibo. Meteor Accounts defines a
[`Meteor.users`](#meteor_users) collection where developers can store
application-specific user data.

Meteor also includes pre-built forms for common tasks like login, signup,
password change, and password reset emails. You can add [Accounts
UI](#accountsui) to your app with just one line of code. The `accounts-ui` package even provides a configuration wizard that walks you through the steps to
set up the external login services you're using in your app.

<template name="reactivity">
{{#markdown}}

<h2 id="reactivity">Reactivity</h2>

Meteor embraces the concept of [reactive
programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming). This means that
you can write your code in a simple imperative style, and the result will be
automatically recalculated whenever data changes that your code depends on.

    Tracker.autorun(function () {
      Meteor.subscribe("messages", Session.get("currentRoomId"));
    });

This example (taken from a chat room client) sets up a data
subscription based on the session variable `currentRoomId`.
If the value of `Session.get("currentRoomId")` changes for any reason, the
function will be automatically re-run, setting up a new subscription that
replaces the old one.

This automatic recomputation is achieved by a cooperation between
`Session` and `Tracker.autorun`.  `Tracker.autorun` performs an arbitrary "reactive
computation" inside of which data dependencies are tracked, and it
will re-run its function argument as necessary.  Data providers like
`Session`, on the other hand, make note of the computation they are
called from and what data was requested, and they are prepared to send
an invalidation signal to the computation when the data changes.

This simple pattern (reactive computation + reactive data source) has wide
applicability.  Above, the programmer is saved from writing
unsubscribe/resubscribe calls and making sure they are called at the
right time.  In general, Meteor can eliminate whole classes of data
propagation code which would otherwise clog up your application with
error-prone logic.

These Meteor functions run your code as a reactive computation:

* [Templates](#livehtmltemplates)
* [`Tracker.autorun`](#tracker_autorun)
* [`Template.autorun`](#template_autorun)
* [`Blaze.render`](#blaze_render) and [`Blaze.renderWithData`](#blaze_renderwithdata)

And the reactive data sources that can trigger changes are:

* [`Session`](#session) variables
* Database queries on [Collections](#find)
* [`Meteor.status`](#meteor_status)
* The `ready()` method on a [subscription handle](#meteor_subscribe)
* [`Meteor.user`](#meteor_user)
* [`Meteor.userId`](#meteor_userid)
* [`Meteor.loggingIn`](#meteor_loggingin)

In addition, the following functions which return an object with a
`stop` method, if called from a reactive computation, are stopped when
the computation is rerun or stopped:

* [`Tracker.autorun`](#tracker_autorun) (nested)
* [`Meteor.subscribe`](#meteor_subscribe)
* [`observe()`](#observe) and [`observeChanges()`](#observe_changes) on cursors

Meteor's
[implementation](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/master/packages/tracker/tracker.js)
is a package called [`Tracker`](#tracker) that is fairly short and straightforward.
You can use it yourself to implement new reactive data sources.

<h2 id="livehtmltemplates">Live HTML templates</h2>

HTML templating is central to web applications. With Blaze, Meteor's live
page update technology, you can render your HTML _reactively_, meaning
that it will update automatically to track changes in the data used to
generate it.

<template name="packages_concept">
{{#markdown}}

<h2 id="usingpackages">Using packages</h2>

All of the functionality you've read about so far is implemented in standard
Meteor packages. This is possible thanks to Meteor's unusually powerful
isomorphic package and build system. Isomorphic means the same packages work in
the web browser, in mobile apps, and on the server. Packages can also contain
plugins that extend the build process, such as `coffeescript`
([CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) compilation) or `templating` (compiling
HTML templates).

Anyone can publish a Meteor package, and thousands of community-written packages
have been published to date. The easiest way to browse these packages is
<a href="http://www.atmospherejs.com">Atmosphere</a>, by Percolate Studio.
You can also use the [`meteor search`](#meteorsearch) and
[`meteor show`](#meteorshow) commands.

You can add packages to your project with [`meteor add`](#meteoradd) and remove
them with [`meteor remove`](#meteorremove).
Additionally, [`meteor list`](#meteorlist) will tell you what
packages your project is using, and [`meteor update`](#meteorupdate)
will update them to the newest versions when possible.

By default all apps include the `meteor-base` package. This pulls in the
packages that make up the core of the Meteor stack. Most apps will have this
package.

All new apps also start with a set of packages that allow a friendly development
experience. For more information about these packages, check out the comments in
the [packages file](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/master/tools/skel/.meteor/packages).

Meteor uses a single-loading packaging system, meaning that it loads just one
version of every package. Before adding or upgrading to a particular version of
a package, Meteor uses a constraint solver to check if doing so will cause
other packages to break. By default, Meteor will choose conservatively. When
adding transitive dependencies (packages that other packages, but not the
application itself) depend on, Meteor will try to choose the earlier version.

In addition to the packages in the official Meteor release being used by your
app, `meteor list` and `meteor add` also search the `packages` directory at the
top of your app. You can also use the `packages` directory to break your app
into subpackages for your convenience, or to test packages that you might want
to publish. See [Writing Packages](#writingpackages). If you wish to add
packages outside of your app's folder structure, set the environment variable
`PACKAGE_DIRS` to a colon-delimited list of paths.

<template name="namespacing">
{{#markdown}}

  <h2 id="namespacing">Namespacing</h2>

Meteor's namespacing support makes it easy to write large applications
in JavaScript. Each package that you use in your app exists in its own
separate namespace, meaning that it sees only its own global variables
and any variables provided by the packages that it specifically
uses. Here's how it works.

When you declare a top-level variable, you have a choice. You can make
the variable File Scope or Package Scope.

    // File Scope. This variable will be visible only inside this
    // one file. Other files in this app or package won't see it.
    var alicePerson = {name: "alice"};

    // Package Scope. This variable is visible to every file inside
    // of this package or app. The difference is that 'var' is
    // omitted.
    bobPerson = {name: "bob"};

Notice that this is just the normal JavaScript syntax for declaring a
variable that is local or global. Meteor scans your source code for
global variable assignments and generates a wrapper that makes sure
that your globals don't escape their appropriate namespace.

In addition to File Scope and Package Scope, there are also
Exports. An export is a variable that a package makes available to you
when you use it. For example, the `email` package exports the `Email`
variable. If your app uses the `email` package (and _only_ if it uses
the `email` package!) then your app can see `Email` and you can call
`Email.send`. Most packages have only one export, but some packages
might have two or three (for example, a package that provides several
classes that work together).

You see only the exports of the packages that you use directly. If you
use package A, and package A uses package B, then you only see package
A's exports. Package B's exports don't "leak" into your namespace just
because you used package A. This keeps each namespace nice and
tidy. Each app or package only sees their own globals plus the APIs of
the packages that they specifically asked for.

When debugging your app, your browser's JavaScript console behaves as
if it were attached to your app's namespace. You see your app's
globals and the exports of the packages that your app uses
directly. You don't see the variables from inside those packages, and
you don't see the exports of your transitive dependencies (packages
that aren't used directly by your app, but that are used by packages
that are used by your app).

If you want to look inside packages from inside your in-browser
debugger, you've got two options:

* Set a breakpoint inside package code. While stopped on that
  breakpoint, the console will be in the package's namespace. You'll
  see the package's package-scope variables, imports, and also any
  file-scope variables for the file you're stopped in.

* If a package `foo` is included in your app, regardless of whether
  your app uses it directly, its exports are available in
  `Package.foo`. For example, if the `email` package is loaded, then
  you can access `Package.email.Email.send` even from namespaces that
  don't use the `email` package directly.

When declaring functions, keep in mind that `function x () {}` is just
shorthand for `var x = function () {}` in JavaScript. Consider these
examples:

    // This is the same as 'var x = function () ...'. So x() is
    // file-scope and can be called only from within this one file.
    function x () { ... }

    // No 'var', so x() is package-scope and can be called from
    // any file inside this app or package.
    x = function () { ... }

{{#note}}
Technically speaking, globals in an app (as opposed to in a package)
are actually true globals. They can't be captured in a scope that is
private to the app code, because that would mean that they wouldn't be
visible in the console during debugging! This means that app globals
actually end up being visible in packages. That should never be a
problem for properly written package code (since the app globals will
still be properly shadowed by declarations in the packages). You
certainly shouldn't depend on this quirk, and in the future Meteor may
check for it and throw an error if you do.

<h2 id="deploying">Deploying</h2>

To learn how to deploy Meteor apps, read the
[deployment article in the Meteor Guide](http://guide.meteor.com/deployment.html).

{{/markdown}}

<template name="packages_writing">
{{#markdown}}

<h2 id="writingpackages">Writing packages</h2>

Writing Meteor packages is easy. To initialize a meteor package, run
`meteor create --package username:packagename`, where `username` is your Meteor
Developer username. This will create a package from scratch and prefill the
directory with a package.js control file and some javascript. By default, Meteor
will take the package name from the name of the directory that contains the
package.js file. Don't forget to run `meteor add [packagename]`, even if the
package is internal to the app, in order to use it.

Meteor promises repeatable builds for both packages and applications. This means
that, if you built your package on a machine, then checked the code into a
repository and checked it out elsewhere, you should get the same result. In your
package directory, you will find an automatically generated `.versions`
file. This file specifies the versions of all packages used to build your
package and is part of the source. Check it into version control to ensure
repeatable builds across machines.

{{#note}}

Sometimes, packages do not just stand on their own, but function in the context
of an app (specifically, packages in the packages directory of an app). In that
case, the app's context will take precedence. Rather than using the
`.versions` file as a guide, we will build the package with the same
dependencies as used by the app (we think that, in practice, it would be
confusing to find your local packages built with different versions of
things).

{{/note}}

Meteor uses extended semver versioning for its packages: that means that the version
number has three parts separated by dots: major version, minor version and patch version
(for example: 1.2.3) with an optional pre-release version. You can read more about it on
[semver.org](http://www.semver.org).
Additionally, because some meteor packages wrap external libraries,
Meteor supports the convention of using `_` to denote a wrap number.

You can read more about [`package.js`](#packagejs) files in the API
section.

A word on testing: since testing is an important part of the development process,
there are two common ways to test a package:

* Integration tests (putting a package directly into an application, and writing
tests against the application) is the most common way to test a package. After
creating your package, add it to your app's /packages directory and run `meteor add`.
This will add your package to your app as a local package. You can then
test and run your app as usual. Meteor will detect and respond to changes to
your local package, just as it does to your app files.

* Unit tests are run with the command [`meteor test-packages package-name`](#meteortestpackages).
As described in the [`package.js`](#packagejs)
section, you can use the `package.js` file to specify where your unit tests are
located. If you have a repository that contains only the package source, you can
test your package by specifying the path to the package directory (which must
contain a slash), such as `meteor test-packages ./`.

To publish a package, run [`meteor publish`](#meteorpublish) from the package
directory.  There are some extra restrictions on published packages: they must
contain a version (Meteor packages are versioned using
strict <a href="http://www.semver.org">semver</a> versioning) and their names
must be prefixed with the username of the author and a colon, like so:
`iron:router`. This namespacing allows for more descriptive and on-topic package
names.
