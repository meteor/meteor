<h2 id="accounts_api"><span>Accounts</span></h2>

The Meteor Accounts system builds on top of the `userId` support in
[`publish`](#publish_userId) and [`methods`](#method_userId). The core
packages add the concept of user documents stored in the database, and
additional packages add [secure password
authentication](#accounts_passwords), [integration with third party
login services](#meteor_loginwithexternalservice), and a [pre-built user
interface](#accountsui).

The basic Accounts system is in the `accounts-base` package, but
applications typically include this automatically by adding one of the
login provider packages: `accounts-password`, `accounts-facebook`,
`accounts-github`, `accounts-google`, `accounts-meetup`,
`accounts-twitter`, or `accounts-weibo`.


{{> autoApiBox "Meteor.user"}}

Retrieves the user record for the current user from
the [`Meteor.users`](#meteor_users) collection.

On the client, this will be the subset of the fields in the document that
are published from the server (other fields won't be available on the
client). By default the server publishes `username`, `emails`, and
`profile` (writable by user). See [`Meteor.users`](#meteor_users) for more on
the fields used in user documents.

{{> autoApiBox "Meteor.userId"}}

{{> autoApiBox "Meteor.users"}}

This collection contains one document per registered user. Here's an example
user document:

    {
      _id: "bbca5d6a-2156-41c4-89da-0329e8c99a4f",  // Meteor.userId()
      username: "cool_kid_13", // unique name
      emails: [
        // each email address can only belong to one user.
        { address: "cool@example.com", verified: true },
        { address: "another@different.com", verified: false }
      ],
      createdAt: Wed Aug 21 2013 15:16:52 GMT-0700 (PDT),
      profile: {
        // The profile is writable by the user by default.
        name: "Joe Schmoe"
      },
      services: {
        facebook: {
          id: "709050", // facebook id
          accessToken: "AAACCgdX7G2...AbV9AZDZD"
        },
        resume: {
          loginTokens: [
            { token: "97e8c205-c7e4-47c9-9bea-8e2ccc0694cd",
              when: 1349761684048 }
          ]
        }
      }
    }

A user document can contain any data you want to store about a user. Meteor
treats the following fields specially:

- `username`: a unique String identifying the user.
- `emails`: an Array of Objects with keys `address` and `verified`;
  an email address may belong to at most one user. `verified` is
  a Boolean which is true if the user has [verified the
  address](#accounts_verifyemail) with a token sent over email.
- `createdAt`: the Date at which the user document was created.
- `profile`: an Object which the user can create and update with any data.
  Do not store anything on `profile` that you wouldn't want the user to edit
  unless you have a deny rule on the `Meteor.users` collection.
- `services`: an Object containing data used by particular
  login services. For example, its `reset` field contains
  tokens used by [forgot password](#accounts_forgotpassword) links,
  and its `resume` field contains tokens used to keep you
  logged in between sessions.

Like all [Mongo.Collection](#collections)s, you can access all
documents on the server, but only those specifically published by the server are
available on the client.

By default, the current user's `username`, `emails` and `profile` are
published to the client. You can publish additional fields for the
current user with:

    // server
    Meteor.publish("userData", function () {
      if (this.userId) {
        return Meteor.users.find({_id: this.userId},
                                 {fields: {'other': 1, 'things': 1}});
      } else {
        this.ready();
      }
    });

    // client
    Meteor.subscribe("userData");

If the autopublish package is installed, information about all users
on the system is published to all clients. This includes `username`,
`profile`, and any fields in `services` that are meant to be public
(eg `services.facebook.id`,
`services.twitter.screenName`). Additionally, when using autopublish
more information is published for the currently logged in user,
including access tokens. This allows making API calls directly from
the client for services that allow this.

Users are by default allowed to specify their own `profile` field with
[`Accounts.createUser`](#accounts_createuser) and modify it with
`Meteor.users.update`. To allow users to edit additional fields, use
[`Meteor.users.allow`](#allow). To forbid users from making any modifications to
their user document:

    Meteor.users.deny({update: function () { return true; }});


{{> autoApiBox "Meteor.loggingIn"}}

For example, [the `accounts-ui` package](#accountsui) uses this to display an
animation while the login request is being processed.

{{> autoApiBox "Meteor.logout"}}

{{> autoApiBox "Meteor.logoutOtherClients"}}

For example, when called in a user's browser, connections in that browser
remain logged in, but any other browsers or DDP clients logged in as that user
will be logged out.

{{> autoApiBox "Meteor.loginWithPassword"}}

If there are multiple users with a username or email only differing in case, a case sensitive match is required. Although `createUser` won't let you create users with ambiguous usernames or emails, this could happen with existing databases or if you modify the users collection directly.

This function is provided by the `accounts-password` package. See the
[Passwords](#accounts_passwords) section below.


{{> autoApiBox "Meteor.loginWith<ExternalService>"}}

Available functions are:

* `Meteor.loginWithMeteorDeveloperAccount`
* `Meteor.loginWithFacebook`
* `Meteor.loginWithGithub`
* `Meteor.loginWithGoogle`
* `Meteor.loginWithMeetup`
* `Meteor.loginWithTwitter`
* `Meteor.loginWithWeibo`

These functions initiate the login process with an external
service (eg: Facebook, Google, etc), using OAuth. When called they open a new pop-up
window that loads the provider's login page. Once the user has logged in
with the provider, the pop-up window is closed and the Meteor client
logs in to the Meteor server with the information provided by the external
service.

<a id="requestpermissions" name="requestpermissions"></a>

In addition to identifying the user to your application, some services
have APIs that allow you to take action on behalf of the user. To
request specific permissions from the user, pass the
`requestPermissions` option the login function. This will cause the user
to be presented with an additional page in the pop-up dialog to permit
access to their data. The user's `accessToken` &mdash; with permissions
to access the service's API &mdash; is stored in the `services` field of
the user document. The supported values for `requestPermissions` differ
for each login service and are documented on their respective developer
sites:

- Facebook: <http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/permissions/>
- GitHub: <http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes>
- Google: <https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2Login#scopeparameter>
- Meetup: <http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/auth/#oauth2-scopes>
- Twitter, Weibo, Meteor developer accounts: `requestPermissions` currently not supported

External login services typically require registering and configuring
your application before use. The easiest way to do this is with the
[`accounts-ui` package](#accountsui) which presents a step-by-step guide
to configuring each service. However, the data can be also be entered
manually in the `ServiceConfiguration.configurations` collection, which
is exported by the `service-configuration` package.

First, add the service configuration package:

```bash
meteor add service-configuration
```

Then, in your app:

```js
ServiceConfiguration.configurations.upsert(
  { service: "weibo" },
  {
    $set: {
      clientId: "1292962797",
      loginStyle: "popup",
      secret: "75a730b58f5691de5522789070c319bc"
    }
  }
);
```

Each external service has its own login provider package and login function. For
example, to support GitHub login, run `$ meteor add accounts-github` and use the
`Meteor.loginWithGithub` function:

    Meteor.loginWithGithub({
      requestPermissions: ['user', 'public_repo']
    }, function (err) {
      if (err)
        Session.set('errorMessage', err.reason || 'Unknown error');
    });

Login service configuration is sent from the server to the client over DDP when
your app starts up; you may not call the login function until the configuration
is loaded. The function `Accounts.loginServicesConfigured()` is a reactive data
source that will return true once the login service is configured; you should
not make login buttons visible or active until it is true.

Ensure that your [`$ROOT_URL`](#meteor_absoluteurl) matches the authorized
domain and callback URL that you configure with the external service (for
instance, if you are running Meteor behind a proxy server, `$ROOT_URL` should be
the externally-accessible URL, not the URL inside your proxy).

{{> autoApiBox "currentUser"}}

{{> autoApiBox "loggingIn"}}

{{> autoApiBox "Accounts.config"}}
{{> autoApiBox "Accounts.ui.config"}}

Example:

    Accounts.ui.config({
      requestPermissions: {
        facebook: ['user_likes'],
        github: ['user', 'repo']
      },
      requestOfflineToken: {
        google: true
      },
      passwordSignupFields: 'USERNAME_AND_OPTIONAL_EMAIL'
    });

{{> autoApiBox "Accounts.validateNewUser"}}

This can be called multiple times. If any of the functions return `false` or
throw an error, the new user creation is aborted. To set a specific error
message (which will be displayed by [`accounts-ui`](#accountsui)), throw a new
[`Meteor.Error`](#meteor_error).

Example:

    // Validate username, sending a specific error message on failure.
    Accounts.validateNewUser(function (user) {
      if (user.username && user.username.length >= 3)
        return true;
      throw new Meteor.Error(403, "Username must have at least 3 characters");
    });
    // Validate username, without a specific error message.
    Accounts.validateNewUser(function (user) {
      return user.username !== "root";
    });

If the user is being created as part of a login attempt from a client (eg,
calling [`Accounts.createUser`](#accounts_createuser) from the client, or
[logging in for the first time with an external
service](#meteor_loginwithexternalservice)), these callbacks are called *before*
the [`Accounts.validateLoginAttempt`](#accounts_validateloginattempt)
callbacks. If these callbacks succeed but those fail, the user will still be
created but the connection will not be logged in as that user.

{{> autoApiBox "Accounts.onCreateUser"}}

Use this when you need to do more than simply accept or reject new user
creation. With this function you can programatically control the
contents of new user documents.

The function you pass will be called with two arguments: `options` and
`user`. The `options` argument comes
from [`Accounts.createUser`](#accounts_createuser) for
password-based users or from an external service login flow. `options` may come
from an untrusted client so make sure to validate any values you read from
it. The `user` argument is created on the server and contains a
proposed user object with all the automatically generated fields
required for the user to log in.

The function should return the user document (either the one passed in or a
newly-created object) with whatever modifications are desired. The returned
document is inserted directly into the [`Meteor.users`](#meteor_users) collection.

The default create user function simply copies `options.profile` into
the new user document. Calling `onCreateUser` overrides the default
hook. This can only be called once.

Example:

<!-- XXX replace d6 with _.random once we have underscore 1.4.2 -->

    // Support for playing D&D: Roll 3d6 for dexterity
    Accounts.onCreateUser(function(options, user) {
      var d6 = function () { return Math.floor(Random.fraction() * 6) + 1; };
      user.dexterity = d6() + d6() + d6();
      // We still want the default hook's 'profile' behavior.
      if (options.profile)
        user.profile = options.profile;
      return user;
    });


{{> autoApiBox "Accounts.validateLoginAttempt"}}

Call `validateLoginAttempt` with a callback to be called on login
attempts.  It returns an object with a single method, `stop`.  Calling
`stop()` unregisters the callback.

When a login attempt is made, the registered validate login callbacks
are called with a single argument, the attempt info object:

<dl class="objdesc">
{{#dtdd name="type" type="String"}}
  The service name, such as "password" or "twitter".
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd name="allowed" type="Boolean"}}
  Whether this login is allowed and will be successful (if not aborted
  by any of the validateLoginAttempt callbacks).  False if the login
  will not succeed (for example, an invalid password or the login was
  aborted by a previous validateLoginAttempt callback).
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd name="error" type="Exception"}}
  When `allowed` is false, the exception describing why the login
  failed.  It will be a `Meteor.Error` for failures reported to the
  user (such as invalid password), and can be a another kind of
  exception for internal errors.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd name="user" type="Object"}}
  When it is known which user was attempting to login, the Meteor user object.
  This will always be present for successful logins.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd name="connection" type="Object"}}
  The `connection` object the request came in on. See
  [`Meteor.onConnection`](#meteor_onconnection) for details.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd name="methodName" type="String"}}
  The name of the Meteor method being used to login.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd name="methodArguments" type="Array"}}
  An array of the arguments passed to the login method.
{{/dtdd}}
</dl>

A validate login callback must return a truthy value for the login to
proceed.  If the callback returns a falsy value or throws an
exception, the login is aborted.  Throwing a `Meteor.Error` will
report the error reason to the user.

All registered validate login callbacks are called, even if one of the callbacks
aborts the login.  The later callbacks will see the `allowed` field set to
`false` since the login will now not be successful.  This allows later callbacks
to override an error from a previous callback; for example, you could override
the "Incorrect password" error with a different message.

Validate login callbacks that aren't explicitly trying to override a previous
error generally have no need to run if the attempt has already been determined
to fail, and should start with

    if (!attempt.allowed)
      return false;


{{> autoApiBox "Accounts.onLogin"}}

See description of [Accounts.onLoginFailure](#accounts_onloginfailure)
for details.

{{> autoApiBox "Accounts.onLoginFailure"}}

Either the `onLogin` or the `onLoginFailure` callbacks will be called
for each login attempt. The `onLogin` callbacks are called after the
user has been successfully logged in. The `onLoginFailure` callbacks are
called after a login attempt is denied.

These functions return an object with a single method, `stop`.  Calling
`stop()` unregisters the callback.

On the server, the callbacks get a single argument, the same attempt info
object as [`validateLoginAttempt`](#accounts_validateloginattempt). On the
client, no arguments are passed.

<h3 id="accounts_rate_limit"><span>Rate Limiting</span></h3>

By default, there are rules added to the [`DDPRateLimiter`](#ddpratelimiter)
that rate limit logins, new user registration and password reset calls to a
limit of 5 requests per 10 seconds per session. These are a basic solution
to dictionary attacks where a malicious user attempts to guess the passwords
of legitimate users by attempting all possible passwords.

These rate limiting rules can be removed by calling
`Accounts.removeDefaultRateLimit()`. Please see the
[`DDPRateLimiter`](#ddpratelimiter) docs for more information.
