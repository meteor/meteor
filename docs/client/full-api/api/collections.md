<h2 id="collections"><span>Collections</span></h2>

Meteor stores data in *collections*.  To get started, declare a
collection with `new Mongo.Collection`.

{{> autoApiBox "Mongo.Collection"}}

Calling this function is analogous to declaring a model in a traditional ORM
(Object-Relation Mapper)-centric framework. It sets up a *collection* (a storage
space for records, or "documents") that can be used to store a particular type
of information, like users, posts, scores, todo items, or whatever matters to
your application.  Each document is a EJSON object.  It includes an `_id`
property whose value is unique in the collection, which Meteor will set when you
first create the document.

    // common code on client and server declares a DDP-managed mongo
    // collection.
    Chatrooms = new Mongo.Collection("chatrooms");
    Messages = new Mongo.Collection("messages");

The function returns an object with methods to [`insert`](#insert)
documents in the collection, [`update`](#update) their properties, and
[`remove`](#remove) them, and to [`find`](#find) the documents in the
collection that match arbitrary criteria. The way these methods work is
compatible with the popular Mongo database API.  The same database API
works on both the client and the server (see below).

    // return array of my messages
    var myMessages = Messages.find({userId: Session.get('myUserId')}).fetch();

    // create a new message
    Messages.insert({text: "Hello, world!"});

    // mark my first message as "important"
    Messages.update(myMessages[0]._id, {$set: {important: true}});

If you pass a `name` when you create the collection, then you are
declaring a persistent collection &mdash; one that is stored on the
server and seen by all users. Client code and server code can both
access the same collection using the same API.

Specifically, when you pass a `name`, here's what happens:

* On the server (if you do not specify a `connection`), a collection with that
name is created on a backend Mongo server. When you call methods on that
collection on the server, they translate directly into normal Mongo operations
(after checking that they match your [access control rules](#allow)).

* On the client (and on the server if you specify a `connection`), a Minimongo
instance is created. Minimongo is essentially an in-memory, non-persistent
implementation of Mongo in pure JavaScript. It serves as a local cache that
stores just the subset of the database that this client is working with. Queries
([`find`](#find)) on these collections are served directly out of this cache,
without talking to the server.

* When you write to the database on the client ([`insert`](#insert),
[`update`](#update), [`remove`](#remove)), the command is executed locally
immediately, and, simultaneously, it's sent to the server and executed
there too. This happens via [stubs](#meteor_methods), because writes are
implemented as methods.

{{#note}}
When, on the server, you write to a collection which has a specified
`connection` to another server, it sends the corresponding method to the other
server and receives the changed values back from it over DDP. Unlike on the
client, it does not execute the write locally first.
{{/note}}

If you pass `null` as the `name`, then you're creating a local
collection. It's not synchronized anywhere; it's just a local scratchpad
that supports Mongo-style [`find`](#find), [`insert`](#insert),
[`update`](#update), and [`remove`](#remove) operations.  (On both the
client and the server, this scratchpad is implemented using Minimongo.)

By default, Meteor automatically publishes every document in your
collection to each connected client.  To turn this behavior off, remove
the `autopublish` package:

    $ meteor remove autopublish

and instead call [`Meteor.publish`](#meteor_publish) to specify which parts of
your collection should be published to which users.

```js
// Create a collection called Posts and put a document in it. The
// document will be immediately visible in the local copy of the
// collection. It will be written to the server-side database
// a fraction of a second later, and a fraction of a second
// after that, it will be synchronized down to any other clients
// that are subscribed to a query that includes it (see
// Meteor.subscribe and autopublish)
Posts = new Mongo.Collection("posts");
Posts.insert({title: "Hello world", body: "First post"});

// Changes are visible immediately -- no waiting for a round trip to
// the server.
assert(Posts.find().count() === 1);

// Create a temporary, local collection. It works just like any other
// collection, but it doesn't send changes to the server, and it
// can't receive any data from subscriptions.
Scratchpad = new Mongo.Collection;
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)
  Scratchpad.insert({number: i * 2});
assert(Scratchpad.find({number: {$lt: 9}}).count() === 5);
```

Generally, you'll assign `Mongo.Collection` objects in your app to global
variables.  You can only create one `Mongo.Collection` object for each
underlying Mongo collection.

If you specify a `transform` option to the `Collection` or any of its retrieval
methods, documents are passed through the `transform` function before being
returned or passed to callbacks.  This allows you to add methods or otherwise
modify the contents of your collection from their database representation.  You
can also specify `transform` on a particular `find`, `findOne`, `allow`, or
`deny` call.  Transform functions must return an object and they may not change
the value of the document's `_id` field (though it's OK to leave it out).

    // An Animal class that takes a document in its constructor
    Animal = function (doc) {
      _.extend(this, doc);
    };
    _.extend(Animal.prototype, {
      makeNoise: function () {
        console.log(this.sound);
      }
    });

    // Define a Collection that uses Animal as its document
    Animals = new Mongo.Collection("Animals", {
      transform: function (doc) { return new Animal(doc); }
    });

    // Create an Animal and call its makeNoise method
    Animals.insert({name: "raptor", sound: "roar"});
    Animals.findOne({name: "raptor"}).makeNoise(); // prints "roar"

`transform` functions are not called reactively.  If you want to add a
dynamically changing attribute to an object, do it with a function that computes
the value at the time it's called, not by computing the attribute at `transform`
time.

{{#warning}}
In this release, Minimongo has some limitations:

* `$pull` in modifiers can only accept certain kinds
of selectors.
* `findAndModify`, aggregate functions, and
map/reduce aren't supported.

All of these will be addressed in a future release. For full
Minimongo release notes, see packages/minimongo/NOTES
in the repository.
{{/warning}}

{{#warning}}
Minimongo doesn't currently have indexes. It's rare for this to be an
issue, since it's unusual for a client to have enough data that an
index is worthwhile.
{{/warning}}

{{> autoApiBox "Mongo.Collection#find"}}

`find` returns a cursor.  It does not immediately access the database or return
documents.  Cursors provide `fetch` to return all matching documents, `map` and
`forEach` to iterate over all matching documents, and `observe` and
`observeChanges` to register callbacks when the set of matching documents
changes.

{{#warning}}
Collection cursors are not query snapshots.  If the database changes
between calling `Collection.find` and fetching the
results of the cursor, or while fetching results from the cursor,
those changes may or may not appear in the result set.
{{/warning}}

Cursors are a reactive data source. On the client, the first time you retrieve a
cursor's documents with `fetch`, `map`, or `forEach` inside a
reactive computation (eg, a template or
[`autorun`](#tracker_autorun)), Meteor will register a
dependency on the underlying data.  Any change to the collection that
changes the documents in a cursor will trigger a recomputation.  To
disable this behavior, pass `{reactive: false}` as an option to
`find`.

Note that when `fields` are specified, only changes to the included
fields will trigger callbacks in `observe`, `observeChanges` and
invalidations in reactive computations using this cursor. Careful use
of `fields` allows for more fine-grained reactivity for computations
that don't depend on an entire document.

{{> autoApiBox "Mongo.Collection#findOne"}}

Equivalent to `find(selector, options).fetch()[0]` with
`options.limit = 1`.

{{> autoApiBox "Mongo.Collection#insert"}}

Add a document to the collection. A document is just an object, and
its fields can contain any combination of EJSON-compatible datatypes
(arrays, objects, numbers, strings, `null`, true, and false).

`insert` will generate a unique ID for the object you pass, insert it
in the database, and return the ID. When `insert` is called from
untrusted client code, it will be allowed only if passes any
applicable [`allow`](#allow) and [`deny`](#deny) rules.

On the server, if you don't provide a callback, then `insert` blocks
until the database acknowledges the write, or throws an exception if
something went wrong.  If you do provide a callback, `insert` still
returns the ID immediately.  Once the insert completes (or fails), the
callback is called with error and result arguments.  In an error case,
`result` is undefined.  If the insert is successful, `error` is
undefined and `result` is the new document ID.

On the client, `insert` never blocks.  If you do not provide a callback
and the insert fails on the server, then Meteor will log a warning to
the console.  If you provide a callback, Meteor will call that function
with `error` and `result` arguments.  In an error case, `result` is
undefined.  If the insert is successful, `error` is undefined and
`result` is the new document ID.

Example:

    var groceriesId = Lists.insert({name: "Groceries"});
    Items.insert({list: groceriesId, name: "Watercress"});
    Items.insert({list: groceriesId, name: "Persimmons"});

{{> autoApiBox "Mongo.Collection#update"}}

Modify documents that match `selector` according to `modifier` (see
[modifier documentation](#modifiers)).

The behavior of `update` differs depending on whether it is called by
trusted or untrusted code. Trusted code includes server code and
method code. Untrusted code includes client-side code such as event
handlers and a browser's JavaScript console.

- Trusted code can modify multiple documents at once by setting
  `multi` to true, and can use an arbitrary [Mongo
  selector](#selectors) to find the documents to modify. It bypasses
  any access control rules set up by [`allow`](#allow) and
  [`deny`](#deny). The number of affected documents will be returned
  from the `update` call if you don't pass a callback.

- Untrusted code can only modify a single document at once, specified
  by its `_id`. The modification is allowed only after checking any
  applicable [`allow`](#allow) and [`deny`](#deny) rules. The number
  of affected documents will be returned to the callback. Untrusted
  code cannot perform upserts, except in insecure mode.

On the server, if you don't provide a callback, then `update` blocks
until the database acknowledges the write, or throws an exception if
something went wrong.  If you do provide a callback, `update` returns
immediately.  Once the update completes, the callback is called with a
single error argument in the case of failure, or a second argument
indicating the number of affected documents if the update was successful.

On the client, `update` never blocks.  If you do not provide a callback
and the update fails on the server, then Meteor will log a warning to
the console.  If you provide a callback, Meteor will call that function
with an error argument if there was an error, or a second argument
indicating the number of affected documents if the update was successful.

Client example:

    // When the givePoints button in the admin dashboard is pressed,
    // give 5 points to the current player. The new score will be
    // immediately visible on everyone's screens.
    Template.adminDashboard.events({
      'click .givePoints': function () {
        Players.update(Session.get("currentPlayer"), {$inc: {score: 5}});
      }
    });

Server example:

    // Give the "Winner" badge to each user with a score greater than
    // 10. If they are logged in and their badge list is visible on the
    // screen, it will update automatically as they watch.
    Meteor.methods({
      declareWinners: function () {
        Players.update({score: {$gt: 10}},
                       {$addToSet: {badges: "Winner"}},
                       {multi: true});
      }
    });

You can use `update` to perform a Mongo upsert by setting the `upsert`
option to true. You can also use the [`upsert`](#upsert) method to perform an
upsert that returns the _id of the document that was inserted (if there was one)
in addition to the number of affected documents.

{{> autoApiBox "Mongo.Collection#upsert"}}

Modify documents that match `selector` according to `modifier`, or insert
a document if no documents were modified. `upsert` is the same as calling
`update` with the `upsert` option set to true, except that the return
value of `upsert` is an object that contain the keys `numberAffected`
and `insertedId`. (`update` returns only the number of affected documents.)

{{> autoApiBox "Mongo.Collection#remove"}}

Find all of the documents that match `selector` and delete them from
the collection.

The behavior of `remove` differs depending on whether it is called by
trusted or untrusted code. Trusted code includes server code and
method code. Untrusted code includes client-side code such as event
handlers and a browser's JavaScript console.

- Trusted code can use an arbitrary [Mongo selector](#selectors) to
  find the documents to remove, and can remove more than one document
  at once by passing a selector that matches multiple documents. It
  bypasses any access control rules set up by [`allow`](#allow) and
  [`deny`](#deny). The number of removed documents will be returned
  from `remove` if you don't pass a callback.

  As a safety measure, if `selector` is omitted (or is `undefined`),
  no documents will be removed. Set `selector` to `{}` if you really
  want to remove all documents from your collection.

- Untrusted code can only remove a single document at a time,
  specified by its `_id`. The document is removed only after checking
  any applicable [`allow`](#allow) and [`deny`](#deny) rules. The
  number of removed documents will be returned to the callback.

On the server, if you don't provide a callback, then `remove` blocks
until the database acknowledges the write and then returns the number
of removed documents, or throws an exception if
something went wrong.  If you do provide a callback, `remove` returns
immediately.  Once the remove completes, the callback is called with a
single error argument in the case of failure, or a second argument
indicating the number of removed documents if the remove was successful.

On the client, `remove` never blocks.  If you do not provide a callback
and the remove fails on the server, then Meteor will log a warning to the
console.  If you provide a callback, Meteor will call that function with an
error argument if there was an error, or a second argument indicating the number
of removed documents if the remove was successful.

Client example:

    // When the remove button is clicked on a chat message, delete
    // that message.
    Template.chat.events({
      'click .remove': function () {
        Messages.remove(this._id);
      }
    });

Server example:

    // When the server starts, clear the log, and delete all players
    // with a karma of less than -2.
    Meteor.startup(function () {
      if (Meteor.isServer) {
        Logs.remove({});
        Players.remove({karma: {$lt: -2}});
      }
    });

{{> autoApiBox "Mongo.Collection#allow"}}

When a client calls `insert`, `update`, or `remove` on a collection, the
collection's `allow` and [`deny`](#deny) callbacks are called
on the server to determine if the write should be allowed. If at least
one `allow` callback allows the write, and no `deny` callbacks deny the
write, then the write is allowed to proceed.

These checks are run only when a client tries to write to the database
directly, for example by calling `update` from inside an event
handler. Server code is trusted and isn't subject to `allow` and `deny`
restrictions. That includes methods that are called with `Meteor.call`
&mdash; they are expected to do their own access checking rather than
relying on `allow` and `deny`.

You can call `allow` as many times as you like, and each call can
include any combination of `insert`, `update`, and `remove`
functions. The functions should return `true` if they think the
operation should be allowed. Otherwise they should return `false`, or
nothing at all (`undefined`). In that case Meteor will continue
searching through any other `allow` rules on the collection.

The available callbacks are:

<dl class="callbacks">
{{#dtdd "insert(userId, doc)"}}
The user `userId` wants to insert the document `doc` into the
collection. Return `true` if this should be allowed.

`doc` will contain the `_id` field if one was explicitly set by the client, or
if there is an active `transform`. You can use this to prevent users from
specifying arbitrary `_id` fields.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "update(userId, doc, fieldNames, modifier)"}}

The user `userId` wants to update a document `doc`. (`doc` is the
current version of the document from the database, without the
proposed update.) Return `true` to permit the change.

`fieldNames` is an array of the (top-level) fields in `doc` that the
client wants to modify, for example
`['name',`&nbsp;`'score']`.

`modifier` is the raw Mongo modifier that
the client wants to execute; for example,
`{$set: {'name.first': "Alice"}, $inc: {score: 1}}`.

Only Mongo modifiers are supported (operations like `$set` and `$push`).
If the user tries to replace the entire document rather than use
$-modifiers, the request will be denied without checking the `allow`
functions.

{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "remove(userId, doc)"}}

The user `userId` wants to remove `doc` from the database. Return
`true` to permit this.

{{/dtdd}}

</dl>

When calling `update` or `remove` Meteor will by default fetch the
entire document `doc` from the database. If you have large documents
you may wish to fetch only the fields that are actually used by your
functions. Accomplish this by setting `fetch` to an array of field
names to retrieve.

Example:

```js
// Create a collection where users can only modify documents that
// they own. Ownership is tracked by an 'owner' field on each
// document. All documents must be owned by the user that created
// them and ownership can't be changed. Only a document's owner
// is allowed to delete it, and the 'locked' attribute can be
// set on a document to prevent its accidental deletion.

Posts = new Mongo.Collection("posts");

Posts.allow({
  insert: function (userId, doc) {
    // the user must be logged in, and the document must be owned by the user
    return (userId && doc.owner === userId);
  },
  update: function (userId, doc, fields, modifier) {
    // can only change your own documents
    return doc.owner === userId;
  },
  remove: function (userId, doc) {
    // can only remove your own documents
    return doc.owner === userId;
  },
  fetch: ['owner']
});

Posts.deny({
  update: function (userId, doc, fields, modifier) {
    // can't change owners
    return _.contains(fields, 'owner');
  },
  remove: function (userId, doc) {
    // can't remove locked documents
    return doc.locked;
  },
  fetch: ['locked'] // no need to fetch 'owner'
});
```

If you never set up any `allow` rules on a collection then all client
writes to the collection will be denied, and it will only be possible to
write to the collection from server-side code. In this case you will
have to create a method for each possible write that clients are allowed
to do. You'll then call these methods with `Meteor.call` rather than
having the clients call `insert`, `update`, and `remove` directly on the
collection.

Meteor also has a special "insecure mode" for quickly prototyping new
applications. In insecure mode, if you haven't set up any `allow` or `deny`
rules on a collection, then all users have full write access to the
collection. This is the only effect of insecure mode. If you call `allow` or
`deny` at all on a collection, even `Posts.allow({})`, then access is checked
just like normal on that collection. __New Meteor projects start in insecure
mode by default.__ To turn it off just run `$ meteor remove insecure`.

{{> autoApiBox "Mongo.Collection#deny"}}

This works just like [`allow`](#allow), except it lets you
make sure that certain writes are definitely denied, even if there is an
`allow` rule that says that they should be permitted.

When a client tries to write to a collection, the Meteor server first
checks the collection's `deny` rules. If none of them return true then
it checks the collection's `allow` rules. Meteor allows the write only
if no `deny` rules return `true` and at least one `allow` rule returns
`true`.

{{> autoApiBox "Mongo.Collection#rawCollection"}}

{{> autoApiBox "Mongo.Collection#rawDatabase"}}

<h2 id="mongo_cursor"><span>Cursors</span></h2>

To create a cursor, use [`find`](#find).  To access the documents in a
cursor, use [`forEach`](#foreach), [`map`](#map), or [`fetch`](#fetch).

{{> autoApiBox "Mongo.Cursor#forEach"}}

This interface is compatible with [Array.forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach).

When called from a reactive computation, `forEach` registers dependencies on
the matching documents.

Examples:

    // Print the titles of the five top-scoring posts
    var topPosts = Posts.find({}, {sort: {score: -1}, limit: 5});
    var count = 0;
    topPosts.forEach(function (post) {
      console.log("Title of post " + count + ": " + post.title);
      count += 1;
    });

{{> autoApiBox "Mongo.Cursor#map"}}

This interface is compatible with [Array.map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map).

When called from a reactive computation, `map` registers dependencies on
the matching documents.

<!-- The following is not yet implemented, but users shouldn't assume
     sequential execution anyway because that will break. -->
On the server, if `callback` yields, other calls to `callback` may occur while
the first call is waiting. If strict sequential execution is necessary, use
`forEach` instead.

{{> autoApiBox "Mongo.Cursor#fetch"}}

When called from a reactive computation, `fetch` registers dependencies on
the matching documents.

{{> autoApiBox "Mongo.Cursor#count"}}

Unlike the other functions, `count` registers a dependency only on the
number of matching documents.  (Updates that just change or reorder the
documents in the result set will not trigger a recomputation.)

{{> autoApiBox "Mongo.Cursor#observe"}}

Establishes a *live query* that invokes callbacks when the result of
the query changes. The callbacks receive the entire contents of the
document that was affected, as well as its old contents, if
applicable. If you only need to receive the fields that changed, see
[`observeChanges`](#observe_changes).

`callbacks` may have the following functions as properties:

<dl class="callbacks">
<dt><span class="name">added(document)</span> <span class="or">or</span></dt>
<dt><span class="name">addedAt(document, atIndex, before)</span></dt>
<dd>
{{#markdown}}
A new document `document` entered the result set. The new document
appears at position `atIndex`. It is immediately before the document
whose `_id` is `before`. `before` will be `null` if the new document
is at the end of the results.
{{/markdown}}
</dd>

<dt><span class="name">changed(newDocument, oldDocument)
    <span class="or">or</span></span></dt>
<dt><span class="name">changedAt(newDocument, oldDocument, atIndex)</span></dt>
<dd>
{{#markdown}}
The contents of a document were previously `oldDocument` and are now
`newDocument`. The position of the changed document is `atIndex`.
{{/markdown}}
</dd>

<dt><span class="name">removed(oldDocument)</span>
  <span class="or">or</span></dt>
<dt><span class="name">removedAt(oldDocument, atIndex)</span></dt>
<dd>
{{#markdown}}
The document `oldDocument` is no longer in the result set. It used to be at position `atIndex`.
{{/markdown}}
</dd>

{{#dtdd "movedTo(document, fromIndex, toIndex, before)"}}
A document changed its position in the result set, from `fromIndex` to `toIndex`
(which is before the document with id `before`). Its current contents is
`document`.
{{/dtdd}}
</dl>

Use `added`, `changed`, and `removed` when you don't care about the
order of the documents in the result set. They are more efficient than
`addedAt`, `changedAt`, and `removedAt`.

Before `observe` returns, `added` (or `addedAt`) will be called zero
or more times to deliver the initial results of the query.

`observe` returns a live query handle, which is an object with a `stop` method.
Call `stop` with no arguments to stop calling the callback functions and tear
down the query. **The query will run forever until you call this.**  If
`observe` is called from a `Tracker.autorun` computation, it is automatically
stopped when the computation is rerun or stopped.
(If the cursor was created with the option `reactive` set to false, it will
only deliver the initial results and will not call any further callbacks;
it is not necessary to call `stop` on the handle.)


{{> autoApiBox "Mongo.Cursor#observeChanges"}}

Establishes a *live query* that invokes callbacks when the result of
the query changes. In contrast to [`observe`](#observe),
`observeChanges` provides only the difference between the old and new
result set, not the entire contents of the document that changed.

`callbacks` may have the following functions as properties:

<dl class="callbacks">
<dt><span class="name">added(id, fields)</span>
  <span class="or">or</span></dt>
<dt><span class="name">addedBefore(id, fields, before)</span></dt>
<dd>
{{#markdown}}
A new document entered the result set. It has the `id` and `fields`
specified. `fields` contains all fields of the document excluding the
`_id` field. The new document is before the document identified by
`before`, or at the end if `before` is `null`.
{{/markdown}}
</dd>

{{#dtdd "changed(id, fields)"}}
The document identified by `id` has changed. `fields` contains the
changed fields with their new values. If a field was removed from the
document then it will be present in `fields` with a value of
`undefined`.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "movedBefore(id, before)"}}
The document identified by `id` changed its position in the ordered result set,
and now appears before the document identified by `before`.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "removed(id)"}}
The document identified by `id` was removed from the result set.
{{/dtdd}}
</dl>

`observeChanges` is significantly more efficient if you do not use
`addedBefore` or `movedBefore`.

Before `observeChanges` returns, `added` (or `addedBefore`) will be called
zero or more times to deliver the initial results of the query.

`observeChanges` returns a live query handle, which is an object with a `stop`
method.  Call `stop` with no arguments to stop calling the callback functions
and tear down the query. **The query will run forever until you call this.**
If
`observeChanges` is called from a `Tracker.autorun` computation, it is automatically
stopped when the computation is rerun or stopped.
(If the cursor was created with the option `reactive` set to false, it will
only deliver the initial results and will not call any further callbacks;
it is not necessary to call `stop` on the handle.)

{{#note}}
Unlike `observe`, `observeChanges` does not provide absolute position
information (that is, `atIndex` positions rather than `before`
positions.) This is for efficiency.
{{/note}}

Example:

```js
// Keep track of how many administrators are online.
var count = 0;
var query = Users.find({admin: true, onlineNow: true});
var handle = query.observeChanges({
  added: function (id, user) {
    count++;
    console.log(user.name + " brings the total to " + count + " admins.");
  },
  removed: function () {
    count--;
    console.log("Lost one. We're now down to " + count + " admins.");
  }
});

// After five seconds, stop keeping the count.
setTimeout(function () {handle.stop();}, 5000);
```

{{> autoApiBox "Mongo.ObjectID"}}

`Mongo.ObjectID` follows the same API as the [Node MongoDB driver
`ObjectID`](http://mongodb.github.com/node-mongodb-native/api-bson-generated/objectid.html)
class. Note that you must use the `equals` method (or [`EJSON.equals`](#ejson_equals)) to
compare them; the `===` operator will not work. If you are writing generic code
that needs to deal with `_id` fields that may be either strings or `ObjectID`s, use
[`EJSON.equals`](#ejson_equals) instead of `===` to compare them.

{{#note}}
  `ObjectID` values created by Meteor will not have meaningful answers to their `getTimestamp`
  method, since Meteor currently constructs them fully randomly.

{{> apiBoxTitle name="Mongo-Style Selectors" id="selectors"}}

The simplest selectors are just a string or
[`Mongo.ObjectID`](#mongo_object_id). These selectors match the
document with that value in its `_id` field.

A slightly more complex form of selector is an object containing a set of keys
that must match in a document:

```js
// Matches all documents where deleted is false
{deleted: false}

// Matches all documents where the name and cognomen are as given
{name: "Rhialto", cognomen: "the Marvelous"}

// Matches every document
{}
```

But they can also contain more complicated tests:

```js
// Matches documents where age is greater than 18
{age: {$gt: 18}}

// Also matches documents where tags is an array containing "popular"
{tags: "popular"}

// Matches documents where fruit is one of three possibilities
{fruit: {$in: ["peach", "plum", "pear"]}}
```

See the [complete
documentation](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/).

{{> apiBoxTitle name="Mongo-Style Modifiers" id="modifiers"}}

A modifier is an object that describes how to update a document in
place by changing some of its fields. Some examples:

```js
// Set the 'admin' property on the document to true
{$set: {admin: true}}

// Add 2 to the 'votes' property, and add "Traz"
// to the end of the 'supporters' array
{$inc: {votes: 2}, $push: {supporters: "Traz"}}
```

But if a modifier doesn't contain any $-operators, then it is instead
interpreted as a literal document, and completely replaces whatever was
previously in the database. (Literal document modifiers are not currently
supported by [validated updates](#allow).)

```
// Find the document with id "123", and completely replace it.
Users.update({_id: "123"}, {name: "Alice", friends: ["Bob"]});
```

See the [full list of
modifiers](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/update/).


{{> apiBoxTitle name="Sort Specifiers" id="sortspecifiers"}}

Sorts may be specified using your choice of several syntaxes:

```
// All of these do the same thing (sort in ascending order by
// key "a", breaking ties in descending order of key "b")

[["a", "asc"], ["b", "desc"]]
["a", ["b", "desc"]]
{a: 1, b: -1}
```

The last form will only work if your JavaScript implementation
preserves the order of keys in objects. Most do, most of the time, but
it's up to you to be sure.



{{> apiBoxTitle name="Field Specifiers" id="fieldspecifiers"}}

Queries can specify a particular set of fields to include or exclude from the
result object.

To exclude specific fields from the result objects, the field specifier is a
dictionary whose keys are field names and whose values are `0`. All unspecified
fields are included.

```js
Users.find({}, {fields: {password: 0, hash: 0}})
```

To include only specific fields in the result documents, use `1` as
the value. The `_id` field is still included in the result.

```js
Users.find({}, {fields: {firstname: 1, lastname: 1}})
```

With one exception, it is not possible to mix inclusion and exclusion styles:
the keys must either be all 1 or all 0.  The exception is that you may specify
`_id: 0` in an inclusion specifier, which will leave `_id` out of the result
object as well.  However, such field specifiers can not be used with
[`observeChanges`](#observe_changes), [`observe`](#observe), cursors returned
from a [publish function](#meteor_publish), or cursors used in
`{{dstache}}#each}}` in a template. They may be used with [`fetch`](#fetch),
[`findOne`](#findone), [`forEach`](#foreach), and [`map`](#map).


<a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/projection/">Field
operators</a> such as `$` and `$elemMatch` are not available on the client side
yet.

A more advanced example:

```js
Users.insert({ alterEgos: [{ name: "Kira", alliance: "murderer" },
                           { name: "L", alliance: "police" }],
               name: "Yagami Light" });

Users.findOne({}, { fields: { 'alterEgos.name': 1, _id: 0 } });

// returns { alterEgos: [{ name: "Kira" }, { name: "L" }] }
```

See <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/project-fields-from-query-results/#projection">
the MongoDB docs</a> for details of the nested field rules and array behavior.
