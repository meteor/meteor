{{#note}}
`Meteor.isServer` can be used to limit where code runs, but it does not
prevent code from being sent to the client. Any sensitive code that you
don't want served to the client, such as code containing passwords or
authentication mechanisms, should be kept in the `server` directory.

{{> autoApiBox "Meteor.startup"}}

On a server, the function will run as soon as the server process is
finished starting. On a client, the function will run as soon as the DOM
is ready.

The `startup` callbacks are called in the same order as the calls to
`Meteor.startup` were made.

On a client, `startup` callbacks from packages will be called
first, followed by `<body>` templates from your `.html` files,
followed by your application code.

    // On server startup, if the database is empty, create some initial data.
    if (Meteor.isServer) {
      Meteor.startup(function () {
        if (Rooms.find().count() === 0) {
          Rooms.insert({name: "Initial room"});
        }
      });
    }
