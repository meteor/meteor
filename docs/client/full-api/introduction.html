<b>_Meteor is an ultra-simple environment for building modern websites.
What once took weeks, even with the best tools, now takes hours with
Meteor._</b>

The web was originally designed to work in the same way that mainframes
worked in the 70s.  The application server rendered a screen and sent it
over the network to a dumb terminal. Whenever the user did anything,
that server rerendered a whole new screen. This model served the Web
well for over a decade. It gave rise to LAMP, Rails, Django, PHP.

But the best teams, with the biggest budgets and the longest schedules,
now build applications in JavaScript that run on the client.  These apps
have stellar interfaces.  They don't reload pages.  They are reactive:
changes from any client immediately appear on everyone's screen.

They've built them the hard way.  Meteor makes it an order of
magnitude simpler, and a lot more fun.  You can build a complete
application in a weekend, or a sufficiently caffeinated hackathon.  No
longer do you need to provision server resources, or deploy API
endpoints in the cloud, or manage a database, or wrangle an ORM layer,
or swap back and forth between JavaScript and Ruby, or broadcast data
invalidations to clients.
