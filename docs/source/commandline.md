title: Command Line
description: Documentation of the various command line options of the Meteor tool.
---

The following are some of the more commonly used commands in the `meteor`
command-line tool. This is just an overview and does not mention every command
or every option to every command; for more details, use the `meteor help`
command.

<!-- XXX some intro text? -->

<h2 id="meteorhelp">meteor help</h2>

Get help on meteor command line usage. Running `meteor help` by
itself will list the common meteor
commands. Running <code>meteor help <i>command</i></code> will print
detailed help about the command.


<h2 id="meteorrun">meteor run</h2>

Run a meteor development server in the current project. Searches
upward from the current directory for the root directory of a Meteor
project. Whenever you change any of the application's source files, the
changes are automatically detected and applied to the running
application.

You can use the application by pointing your web browser at
<a href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a>. No Internet connection is
required.

This is the default command. Simply running `meteor` is the
same as `meteor run`.

To pass additional options to Node.js use the `SERVER_NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable. E.g. for Windows PowerShell:
`$env:SERVER_NODE_OPTIONS = '--inspect' | meteor run`. Or for Linux: `SERVER_NODE_OPTIONS=--inspect-brk meteor run`.

To specify a port to listen on (instead of the default 3000), use `--port [PORT]`.
(The development server also uses port `N+1` for the default MongoDB instance)

For example: `meteor run --port 4000`
will run the development server on `http://localhost:4000`
and the development MongoDB instance on `mongodb://localhost:4001`.

To open your default browser you can pass the `--open` flag.
For example: `meteor run --open`

Run `meteor help run` to see the full list of options.

<h2 id="meteordebug">meteor debug</h2>

Run the project, but suspend the server process for debugging.

> **NOTE:** The `meteor debug` command has been superseded by the more flexible
> `--inspect` and `--inspect-brk` command-line flags, which work for any `run`,
> `test`, or `test-packages` command.
>
> The syntax of these flags is the same as the equivalent Node.js
> [flags](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector/#command-line-options),
> with two notable differences:
>
> * The flags affect the server process spawned by the build process,
>   rather than affecting the build process itself.
>
> * The `--inspect-brk` flag causes the server process to pause just after
>   server code has loaded but before it begins to execute, giving the
>   developer a chance to set breakpoints in server code.

The server process will be suspended just before the first statement of
server code that would normally execute. In order to continue execution of
server code, use either the web-based Node Inspector or the command-line
debugger (further instructions will be printed in the console).

Breakpoints can be set using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/debugger" target="_blank">`debugger` keyword</a>, or through the web UI of Node Inspector ("Sources" tab).

The server process debugger will listen for incoming connections from
debugging clients, such as node-inspector, on port 5858 by default. To
specify a different port use the `--debug-port <port>` option.

The same debugging functionality can be achieved by adding the `--debug-port <port>`
option to other `meteor` tool commands, such as `meteor run` and `meteor test-packages`.

> **Note:** Due to a [bug in `node-inspector`](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/issues/903), pushing "Enter" after a command on the Node Inspector Console will not successfully send the command to the server.  If you require this functionality, please consider using Safari or `meteor shell` in order to interact with the server console until the `node-inspector` project [fixes the bug](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/pull/955).  Alternatively, there is a hot-patch available [in this comment](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/7991#issuecomment-266709459) on [#7991](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/7991).


<h2 id="meteorcreate">meteor create <i>app-name</i></h2>

The command `meteor create app-name` is the default command for creating a new Meteor project. It creates a subdirectory
named `app-name` and copies a template app into it. You can pass an absolute or relative path. If you pass a relative
path, it will be resolved relative to the current working directory. By default, it generates a React project.

See the flags below to learn how you can generate different types of apps.

Using only `meteor create` will create a promt to help you choose the type of app you want to create,
giving you the options with the flags below.

<h2 id="meteorgenerate"> meteor generate </h2>

``meteor generate`` is a command for generating scaffolds for your current project. When ran without arguments, it will ask
you what is the name of the model you want to generate, if you do want methods for your api and publications. It can be
used as a command line only operation as well.

> _Important to note:_
> By default, the generator will use JavaScript but if it detects that you have a
``tsconfig.json`` file in your project, it will use TypeScript instead.

running
```bash
meteor generate customer

```

It will generate the following code in ``/imports/api``
![Screenshot 2022-11-09 at 11 28 29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70247653/200856551-71c100f5-8714-4b34-9678-4f08780dcc8b.png)

That will have the following code:


<h3 id="meteorgenerate-collection.js">collection.js</h3>

```js

 import { Mongo } from 'meteor/mongo';

export const CustomerCollection = new Mongo.Collection('customer');

```



<h3 id="meteorgenerate-methods.js">methods.js</h3>

```js
import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';
import { check } from 'meteor/check';
import { CustomerCollection } from './collection';

export async function create(data) {
  return CustomerCollection.insertAsync({ ...data });
}

export async function update(_id, data) {
  check(_id, String);
  return CustomerCollection.updateAsync(_id, { ...data });
}

export async function remove(_id) {
  check(_id, String);
  return CustomerCollection.removeAsync(_id);
}

export async function findById(_id) {
  check(_id, String);
  return CustomerCollection.findOneAsync(_id);
}

Meteor.methods({
  'Customer.create': create,
  'Customer.update': update,
  'Customer.remove': remove,
  'Customer.find': findById
});

```



<h3 id="meteorgenerate-publication.js">publication.js</h3>

```js

import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';
import { CustomerCollection } from './collection';

Meteor.publish('allCustomers', function publishCustomers() {
  return CustomerCollection.find({});
});


```




<h3 id="meteorgenerate-index.js">index.js</h3>

```js

export * from './collection';
export * from './methods';
export * from './publications';

```

Also, there is the same version of these methods using TypeScript, that will be shown bellow.

<h3 id="meteorgenerate-path">path option</h3>

If you want to create in another path, you can use the ``--path`` option in order to select where to place this boilerplate.
It will generate the model in that path. Note that is used TypeScript in this example.

```bash

meteor generate another-customer --path=server/admin

```

It will generate in ``server/admin`` the another-client code:

  return AnotherCustomerCollection.insertAsync({ ...data });
}

export async function update(_id: string, data: Mongo.Modifier<AnotherCustomer>) {
  check(_id, String);
  return AnotherCustomerCollection.updateAsync(_id, { ...data });
}

export async function remove(_id: string) {
  check(_id, String);
  return AnotherCustomerCollection.removeAsync(_id);
}

export async function findById(_id: string) {
  check(_id, String);
  return AnotherCustomerCollection.findOneAsync(_id);
}

Meteor.methods({
  'AnotherCustomer.create': create,
  'AnotherCustomer.update': update,
  'AnotherCustomer.remove': remove,
  'AnotherCustomer.find': findById
});


```



<h3 id="meteorgenerate-publications.ts">publications.ts</h3>

```typescript

import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';
import { AnotherCustomerCollection } from './collection';

Meteor.publish('allAnotherCustomers', function publishAnotherCustomers() {
  return AnotherCustomerCollection.find({});

<h3 id="meteorgenerate-templating"> Using your own template </h3>

`--templatePath`

```bash
meteor generate feed --templatePath=/scaffolds-ts
```
![Screenshot 2022-11-09 at 11 42 47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70247653/200860178-2341befe-bcfd-422f-a4bd-7c9918abfd97.png)

> Note that this is not a CLI framework inside meteor but just giving some solutions for really common problems out of the box.
> Check out Yargs, Inquirer or Commander for more information about CLI frameworks.


You can use your own templates for scaffolding your specific workloads. To do that, you should pass in a template directory URL so that it can copy it with its changes.

<h3 id="meteorgenerate-template-rename"> How to rename things?</h3>

Out of the box is provided a few functions such as replacing ``$$name$$``, ``$$PascalName$$`` and ``$$camelName$$``

these replacements come from this function:

_Note that scaffoldName is the name that you have passed as argument_

```js
const transformName = (name) => {
    return name.replace(/\$\$name\$\$|\$\$PascalName\$\$|\$\$camelName\$\$/g, function (substring, args) {
      if (substring === '$$name$$') return scaffoldName;
      if (substring === '$$PascalName$$') return toPascalCase(scaffoldName);
      if (substring === '$$camelName$$') return toCamelCase(scaffoldName);
    })
  }
```

<h3 id="meteorgenerate-template-faq"> How to bring your own templates? </h3>

`--replaceFn`

There is an option called ``--replaceFn`` that when you pass in given a .js file with two functions it will override all templating that we have defaulted to use your given function.
_example of a replacer file_
```js
export function transformFilename(scaffoldName, filename) {
  console.log(scaffoldName, filename);
  return filename
}

export function transformContents(scaffoldName, contents, fileName) {
  console.log(fileName, contents);
  return contents
}

```
If you run your command like this:

```bash
 meteor generate feed --replaceFn=/fn/replace.js
```
It will generate files full of ``$$PascalCase$$``using the meteor provided templates.

A better example of this feature would be the following js file:
```js
const toPascalCase = (str) => {
  if(!str.includes('-')) return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
  else return str.split('-').map(toPascalCase).join('');
}
const toCamelCase = (str) => {
  if(!str.includes('-')) return str.charAt(0).toLowerCase() + str.slice(1);
  else return str.split('-').map(toPascalCase).join('');
}

const transformName = (scaffoldName, str) => {
    return str.replace(/\$\$name\$\$|\$\$PascalName\$\$|\$\$camelName\$\$/g, function (substring, args) {
      if (substring === '$$name$$') return scaffoldName;
      if (substring === '$$PascalName$$') return toPascalCase(scaffoldName);
      if (substring === '$$camelName$$') return toCamelCase(scaffoldName);
    })

}

export function transformFilename(scaffoldName, filename) {
  return transformName(scaffoldName, filename);
}

export function transformContents(scaffoldName, contents, fileName) {
  return transformName(scaffoldName, contents);
}
```




<h2 id="meteorloginlogout">meteor login / logout</h2>

Log in and out of your account using Meteor's authentication system.

You can pass `METEOR_SESSION_FILE=token.json` before `meteor login` to generate
a login session token so you don't have to share your login credentials with
third-party service providers.

Once you have your account you can log in and log out from the command line, and
check your username with `meteor whoami`.

<h2 id="meteordeploy">meteor deploy <i>site</i></h2>

Deploy the project in your current directory to
<a href="https://www.meteor.com/galaxy" target="_blank">Galaxy</a>.

Use `--owner` to decide which organization or user account you'd like to deploy
a new app to if you are a member of more than one Galaxy-enabled account.

You can deploy in debug mode by passing `--debug`. This
will leave your source code readable by your favorite in-browser
debugger, just like it is in local development mode.



To delete an application you've deployed, specify
the `--delete` option along with the site.



You can add information specific to a particular deployment of your application
by using the `--settings` option.  The argument to `--settings` is a file
containing any JSON string.  The object in your settings file will appear on the
server side of your application in [`Meteor.settings`](#meteor_settings).

Settings are persistent.  When you redeploy your app, the old value will be
preserved unless you explicitly pass new settings using the `--settings` option.
To unset `Meteor.settings`, pass an empty settings file.

{% pullquote warning %}
`free` and `mongo` options were introduced in Meteor 2.0
{% endpullquote %}

You can run your app for free using the option `--free`. But, there are some limitations. The first one is that you cannot use a custom domain to run a free app. Your domain must contain a Meteor domain name (`.meteorapp.com` to US region, `.au.meteorapp.com` to Asia region, or `.eu.meteorapp.com` to Europe region). Second thing you must know is that your free apps have Cold Start enabled. Cold Start means that your app will stop if it has no connection for 10 minutes, and it will go automatically up when someone tries to connect to it. The third thing you must know is that free apps run on one, and just one, Tiny container. This is important to know, because Tiny containers are NOT meant to production environment, so even small apps can crash with a lot of connections. To keep your app on free, you always need to provide this option.

With the option `--mongo` you can deploy your app without having to pay for a MongoDB provider. By providing this option, Galaxy will create a database for you in our shared cluster and inject the mongo URL on your settings. So with this, you don't even need to provide the settings file anymore (if your settings files just have the mongo URL of course). This is great to test apps, but it shouldn't be used in a production environment, as you will be running in a shared Cluster with limited space. The rules behind this option are: If it is the first deploy of the app, and you provided the option `--mongo`, after the deploy is finished you will receive your mongo URL on your console (you can also see your URL on Galaxy in your app's version). You can put that URL on your settings file if want to. If you try to do a second without the option `--mongo` and without providing a mongo URL on your settings, your deploy will fail as usual. If you provide the option `--mongo` and a mongo URL, the mongo URL on your settings file is the one that will be used by Galaxy to connect your app to a MongoDB. One last thing, you need to have at least one document in your database so Meteor is really going to instantiate it. Then you will be able to access it using any MongoDB client with the provided URI.

Use the options `--mongo` and `--free` to easily deploy a free app already with a mongo database connected to it.

{% pullquote warning %}
Free apps and MongoDB shared hosting: Meteor Software reserves the right to stop or remove applications we deem to be abusing the free plan offering at any time. Please be advised that the free plan offering is not recommended for production applications. The shared MongoDB cluster that comes configured with the free plan does not provide backups or restoration resources.
{% endpullquote %}

{% pullquote warning %}
If you want to connect to your free MongoDB shared cluster using your on settings make sure you include this option in your settings in the Mongo package configuration section:
```
packages: {
  mongo: {
    options: {
        tlsAllowInvalidCertificates: true,
    },
  },
}
```
This is necessary as our database provider does not have certificates installed on every machine and we don't want to force apps to have this certificate. More about this option [here](https://docs.meteor.com/api/collections.html#mongo_connection_options_settings)
{% endpullquote %}


You can change the app plan by providing argument `--plan` with one of the following values: professional, essentials, or free. Be aware that this argument overwrites the `--free` argument.

{% pullquote warning %}
The `plan` option is available since Meteor 2.1.
{% endpullquote %}

Use `--cache-build` to keep the bundle in your temp folder after the deploy is finished, this is helpful when you want to deploy the same code to different environments. For example, a [background job](https://cloud-guide.meteor.com/background-jobs.html) app from the same code as the web app.

Your project should be a git repository as the commit hash is going to be used to decide if your code is still the same or not in the next deploy.

{% pullquote warning %}
The `cache-build` option is available since Meteor 1.11.
{% endpullquote %}

With the argument `--container-size` you can change your app's container size using the deploy command. The valid arguments are: `tiny`, `compact`, `standard`, `double`, `quad`, `octa`, and `dozen`. One more thing to note here is that the `--container-size` flag can only be used when the `--plan` option is already specified, otherwise using the `--container-size` option will throw an error with the message : `Error deploying application: Internal error`. To see more about the difference and prices of each one you can check [here](https://www.meteor.com/cloud#pricing-section).

{% pullquote warning %}
The `--container-size` option is available since Meteor 2.4.1.
{% endpullquote %}

<h2 id="meteorupdate">meteor update</h2>

Attempts to bring you to the latest version of Meteor, and then to upgrade your
packages to their latest versions. By default, update will not break
compatibility.

For example, let's say packages A and B both depend on version 1.1.0 of package
X. If a new version of A depends on X@2.0.0, but there is no new version of
package B, running `meteor update` will not update A, because doing so will
break package B.

You can pass in the flag `--packages-only` to update only the packages, and not
the release itself. Similarly, you can pass in names of packages
(`meteor update foo:kittens baz:cats`) to only update specific packages.

Every project is pinned to a specific release of Meteor. You can temporarily try
using your package with another release by passing the `--release` option to any
command; `meteor update` changes the pinned release.

Sometimes, Meteor will ask you to run `meteor update --patch`. Patch releases
are special releases that contain only very minor changes (usually crucial bug
fixes) from previous releases. We highly recommend that you always run `update
--patch` when prompted.

You may also pass the `--release` flag to act as an override to update to a
specific release. This is an override: if it cannot find compatible versions of
packages, it will log a warning, but perform the update anyway. This will only
change your package versions if necessary.


<h2 id="meteoradd">meteor add <i>package</i></h2>

Add packages to your Meteor project. By convention, names of community packages
include the name of the maintainer. For example: `meteor add iron:router`. You
can add multiple packages with one command.

Optionally, adds version constraints. Running `meteor add package@1.1.0` will
add the package at version `1.1.0` or higher (but not `2.0.0` or higher). If you
want to use version `1.1.0` exactly, use `meteor add package@=1.1.0`. You can also
'or' constraints together: for example, `meteor add 'package@=1.0.0 || =2.0.1'`
means either 1.0.0 (exactly) or 2.0.1 (exactly).

To remove a version constraint for a specific package, run `meteor add` again
without specifying a version. For example above, to stop using version `1.1.0`
exactly, run `meteor add package`.


<h2 id="meteorremove">meteor remove <i>package</i></h2>

Removes a package previously added to your Meteor project. For a
list of the packages that your application is currently using, run
`meteor list`.

This removes the package entirely. To continue using the package,
but remove its version constraint, use [`meteor add`](#meteoradd).

Meteor does not downgrade transitive dependencies unless it's necessary. This
means that if running `meteor add A` upgrades A's parent package X to a new
version, your project will continue to use X at the new version even after you
run `meteor remove A`.


<h2 id="meteorlist">meteor list</h2>

Lists all the packages that you have added to your project. For each package,
lists the version that you are using. Lets you know if a newer version of that
package is available.

**Flags**

Flags are optional and can be used to format the output. The default output
requires no flags whatsoever. The following flags are supported:

`--tree`

Outputs a tree showing how packages are referenced.

`--json`

Outputs an unformatted JSON String, showing how packages are referenced.

`--weak`

Show weakly referenced dependencies in the tree.
Only functional in combination with `--tree` or `--json`.

`--details`

Adds more package details to the JSON output.
Only functional in combination with `--json`.


<h2 id="meteoraddplatform">meteor add-platform <i>platform</i></h2>

Adds platforms to your Meteor project. You can add multiple
platforms with one command. Once a platform has been added, you
can use 'meteor run <i>platform</i>' to run on the platform, and `meteor build`
to build the Meteor project for every added platform.


<h2 id="meteorremoveplatform">meteor remove-platform <i>platform</i></h2>

Removes a platform previously added to your Meteor project. For a
list of the platforms that your application is currently using, see
`meteor list-platforms`.


<h2 id="meteorlistplatforms">meteor list-platforms</h2>

Lists all of the platforms that have been explicitly added to your project.


<h2 id="meteorensurecordovadependencies">meteor ensure-cordova-dependencies</h2>

Check if the dependencies are installed, otherwise install them.

<h2 id="meteormongo">meteor mongo</h2>

Open a MongoDB shell on your local development database, so that you
can view or manipulate it directly.

{% pullquote warning %}
For now, you must already have your application running locally
with `meteor run`. This will be easier in the future.
{% endpullquote %}


<h2 id="meteorreset">meteor reset</h2>

Reset the current project to a fresh state. Removes the local
mongo database.

{% pullquote warning %}
This deletes your data! Make sure you do not have any information you
care about in your local mongo database by running `meteor mongo`.
From the mongo shell, use `show collections`
and <code>db.<i>collection</i>.find()</code> to inspect your data.
{% endpullquote %}

{% pullquote warning %}
For now, you can not run this while a development server is
running. Quit all running meteor applications before running this.
{% endpullquote %}


<h2 id="meteorbuild">meteor build</h2>

Package this project up for deployment. The output is a directory with several
build artifacts:

<ul><li>a tarball (.tar.gz) that includes everything necessary to run the application
  server (see the <code>README</code> in the tarball for details).  Using the
  `--directory` option will produce a `bundle` directory instead of the tarball.</li>
<li>an unsigned <code>apk</code> bundle and a project source if Android is targeted as a
  mobile platform</li>
<li>a directory with an Xcode project source if iOS is targeted as a mobile
  platform</li></ul>

You can use the application server bundle to host a Meteor application on your
own server, instead of deploying to Galaxy.  You will have to deal
with logging, monitoring, backups, load-balancing, etc, all of which we handle
for you if you use Galaxy.

The unsigned `apk` bundle and the outputted Xcode project can be used to deploy
your mobile apps to Android Play Store and Apple App Store.

By default, your application is bundled for your current architecture.
This may cause difficulties if your app contains binary code due to,
for example, npm packages. You can try to override that behavior
with the `--architecture` flag.

You can set optional data for the initial value of `Meteor.settings`
in your mobile application with the `--mobile-settings` flag. A new value for
`Meteor.settings` can be set later by the server as part of hot code push.

You can also specify which platforms you want to build with the `--platforms` flag.
Examples: `--platforms=android`, `--platforms=ios`, `--platforms=web.browser`.

<h2 id="meteorlint">meteor lint</h2>

Run through the whole build process for the app and run all linters the app
uses. Outputs all build errors or linting warnings to the standard output.


<h2 id="meteorsearch">meteor search</h2>

Searches for Meteor packages and releases, whose names contain the specified
regular expression.


<h2 id="meteorshow">meteor show</h2>

Shows more information about a specific package or release: name, summary, the
usernames of its maintainers, and, if specified, its homepage and git URL.

Get information on meteor recommended releases:
```
meteor show METEOR
```

Get information on all meteor releases (including intermediate releases)"
```
meteor show --show-all METEOR
```


<h2 id="meteorpublish">meteor publish</h2>

Publishes your package. To publish, you must `cd` into the package directory, log
in with your Meteor Developer Account and run `meteor publish`. By convention,
published package names must begin with the maintainer's Meteor Developer
Account username and a colon, like so: `iron:router`.

To publish a package for the first time, use `meteor publish --create`.

Sometimes packages may contain binary code specific to an architecture (for
example, they may use an npm package). In that case, running publish will only
upload the build to the architecture that you were using to publish it. You can
use `publish-for-arch` to upload a build to a different architecture from a
different machine.

If you have already published a package but need to update it's metadata
(the content of `Package.describe`) or the README you can actually achieve this
via `meteor publish --update`.

<h2 id="meteorpublishforarch">meteor publish-for-arch</h2>

Publishes a build of an existing package version from a different architecture.

Some packages contain code specific to an architecture. Running `publish` by
itself, will upload the build to the architecture that you were using to
publish. You need to run `publish-for-arch` from a different architecture to
upload a different build.

For example, let's say you published name:cool-binary-blob from a Mac. If you
want people to be able to use cool-binary-blob from Linux, you should log into a
Linux machine and then run
`meteor publish-for-arch name:cool-binary-blob@version`.  It will notice that you
are on a linux machine, and that there is no Linux-compatible build for your package
and publish one.

Currently, the supported architectures for Meteor are 32-bit Linux, 64-bit Linux
and Mac OS. Galaxy's servers run 64-bit Linux.


<h2 id="meteorpublishrelease">meteor publish-release</h2>

Publishes a release of Meteor. Takes in a JSON configuration file.

Meteor releases are divided into tracks. While only MDG members can publish to
the default Meteor track, anyone can create a track of their own and publish to
it. Running `meteor update` without specifying the `--release` option will not
cause the user to switch tracks.

To publish to a release track for the first time, use the `--create-track` flag.

The JSON configuration file must contain the name of the release track
(`track`), the release version (`version`), various metadata, the packages
specified by the release as mapped to versions (`packages`), and the package &
version of the Meteor command-line tool (`tool`). Note that this means that
forks of the meteor tool can be published as packages and people can use them by
switching to a corresponding release. For more information, run
`meteor help publish-release`.


<h2 id="meteortestpackages">meteor test-packages</h2>

Test Meteor packages, either by name, or by directory. Not specifying an
argument will run tests for all local packages. The results are displayed in an
app that runs at `localhost:3000` by default. If you need to, you can pass the
`--settings` and `--port` arguments.


<h2 id="meteoradmin">meteor admin</h2>

Catch-all for miscellaneous commands that require authorization to use.

Some example uses of `meteor admin` include adding and removing package
maintainers and setting a homepage for a package. It also includes various
helpful functions for managing a Meteor release.  Run `meteor help admin` for
more information.

<h2 id="meteorshell">meteor shell</h2>

When `meteor shell` is executed in an application directory where a server
is already running, it connects to the server and starts an interactive
shell for evaluating server-side code.

Multiple shells can be attached to the same server. If no server is
currently available, `meteor shell` will keep trying to connect until it
succeeds.

Exiting the shell does not terminate the server. If the server restarts
because a change was made in server code, or a fatal exception was
encountered, the shell will restart along with the server. This behavior
can be simulated by typing `.reload` in the shell.

The shell supports tab completion for global variables like `Meteor`,
`Mongo`, and `Package`. Try typing `Meteor.is` and then pressing tab.

The shell maintains a persistent history across sessions. Previously-run
commands can be accessed by pressing the up arrow.

<h2 id="meteornpm">meteor npm</h2>

The `meteor npm` command calls the
[`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) version bundled
with Meteor itself.

Additional parameters can be passed in the same way as the `npm` command
(e.g. `meteor npm rebuild`, `meteor npm ls`, etc.) and the
[npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/) should be consulted for the
full list of commands and for a better understanding of their usage.

For example, executing `meteor npm install lodash --save` would install `lodash`
from npm to your `node_modules` directory and save its usage in your
[`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) file.

Using the `meteor npm ...` commands in place of traditional `npm ...` commands
is particularly important when using Node.js modules that have binary
dependencies that make native C calls (like [`bcrypt`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt))
because doing so ensures that they are built using the same libraries.

Additionally, this access to the npm that comes with Meteor avoids the need to
download and install npm separately.

<h2 id="meteornode">meteor node</h2>

The `meteor node` command calls the
[`node`](https://nodejs.org) version bundled with Meteor itself.

> This is not to be confused with [`meteor shell`](#meteorshell), which provides
> an almost identical experience but also gives you access to the "server" context
> of a Meteor application. Typically, `meteor shell` will be preferred.

Additional parameters can be passed in the same way as the `node` command, and
the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v4.x/docs/api/cli.html)
should be consulted for the full list of commands and for a better understanding
of their usage.

For example, executing `meteor node` will enter the Node.js
[Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL)](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v4.x/docs/api/repl.html)
interface and allow you to interactively run JavaScript and see the results.

Executing `meteor node -e "console.log(process.versions)"` would
run `console.log(process.versions)` in the version of `node` bundled with Meteor.
