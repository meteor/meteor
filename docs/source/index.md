<h2 id="what-is-meteor">What is Meteor?</h2>

Meteor is a full-stack JavaScript platform for developing modern web and mobile applications. Meteor includes a key set of technologies for building connected-client reactive applications, a build tool, and a curated set of packages from the Node.js and general JavaScript community.

- Meteor allows you to develop in **one language**, JavaScript, in all environments: application server, web browser, and mobile device.

- Meteor uses **data on the wire**, meaning the server sends data, not HTML, and the client renders it.

- Meteor **embraces the ecosystem**, bringing the best parts of the extremely active JavaScript community to you in a careful and considered way.

- Meteor provides **full stack reactivity**, allowing your UI to seamlessly reflect the true state of the world with minimal development effort.
