title: Accounts (multi-server)
order: 8
---

The `accounts-base` package exports two constructors, called
`AccountsClient` and `AccountsServer`, which are used to create the
`Accounts` object that is available on the client and the server,
respectively.

This predefined `Accounts` object (along with similar convenience methods
of `Meteor`, such as [`Meteor.logout`](#meteor_logout)) is sufficient to
implement most accounts-related logic in Meteor apps. Nevertheless, these
two constructors can be instantiated more than once, to create multiple
independent connections between different accounts servers and their
clients, in more complicated authentication situations.

{% apibox "AccountsCommon" %}

The `AccountsClient` and `AccountsServer` classes share a common
superclass, `AccountsCommon`. Methods defined on
`AccountsCommon.prototype` will be available on both the client and the
server, via the predefined `Accounts` object (most common) or any custom
`accountsClientOrServer` object created using the `AccountsClient` or
`AccountsServer` constructors (less common).

Here are a few of those methods:

{% apibox "AccountsCommon#userId" %}

{% apibox "AccountsCommon#user" %}

{% apibox "AccountsCommon#config" %}

{% apibox "AccountsCommon#onLogin" %}

See description of [AccountsCommon#onLoginFailure](#accounts_onloginfailure)
for details.

{% apibox "AccountsCommon#onLoginFailure" %}

Either the `onLogin` or the `onLoginFailure` callbacks will be called
for each login attempt. The `onLogin` callbacks are called after the
user has been successfully logged in. The `onLoginFailure` callbacks are
called after a login attempt is denied.

These functions return an object with a single method, `stop`.  Calling
`stop()` unregisters the callback.

On the server, the callbacks get a single argument, the same attempt info
object as [`validateLoginAttempt`](#accounts_validateloginattempt). On the
client, no arguments are passed.



{% apibox "AccountsClient" %}

At most one of `options.connection` and `options.ddpUrl` should be
provided in any instantiation of `AccountsClient`. If neither is provided,
`Meteor.connection` will be used as the `.connection` property of the
`AccountsClient` instance.

Note that `AccountsClient` is currently available only on the client, due
to its use of browser APIs such as `window.localStorage`. In principle,
though, it might make sense to establish a client connection from one
server to another remote accounts server. Please [let us
know](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Contributing-to-Meteor#feature-requests)
if you find yourself needing this server-to-server functionality.


These methods are defined on `AccountsClient.prototype`, and are thus
available only on the client:

{% apibox "AccountsClient#loggingIn" %}

{% apibox "AccountsClient#logout" %}

{% apibox "AccountsClient#logoutOtherClients" %}

{% apibox "AccountsServer" %}

These methods are defined on `AccountsServer.prototype`, and are thus
available only on the server:

{% apibox "AccountsServer#validateNewUser" %}

This can be called multiple times. If any of the functions return `false` or
throw an error, the new user creation is aborted. To set a specific error
message (which will be displayed by [`accounts-ui`](#accountsui)), throw a new
[`Meteor.Error`](#meteor_error).

Example:

```js
// Validate username, sending a specific error message on failure.
Accounts.validateNewUser(function (user) {
  if (user.username && user.username.length >= 3)
    return true;
  throw new Meteor.Error(403, "Username must have at least 3 characters");
});
// Validate username, without a specific error message.
Accounts.validateNewUser(function (user) {
  return user.username !== "root";
});
```

If the user is being created as part of a login attempt from a client (eg,
calling [`Accounts.createUser`](#accounts_createuser) from the client, or
[logging in for the first time with an external
service](#meteor_loginwithexternalservice)), these callbacks are called *before*
the [`Accounts.validateLoginAttempt`](#accounts_validateloginattempt)
callbacks. If these callbacks succeed but those fail, the user will still be
created but the connection will not be logged in as that user.

{% apibox "AccountsServer#onCreateUser" %}

Use this when you need to do more than simply accept or reject new user
creation. With this function you can programatically control the
contents of new user documents.

The function you pass will be called with two arguments: `options` and
`user`. The `options` argument comes
from [`Accounts.createUser`](#accounts_createuser) for
password-based users or from an external service login flow. `options` may come
from an untrusted client so make sure to validate any values you read from
it. The `user` argument is created on the server and contains a
proposed user object with all the automatically generated fields
required for the user to log in, including the `_id`.

The function should return the user document (either the one passed in or a
newly-created object) with whatever modifications are desired. The returned
document is inserted directly into the [`Meteor.users`](#meteor_users) collection.

The default create user function simply copies `options.profile` into
the new user document. Calling `onCreateUser` overrides the default
hook. This can only be called once.

Example:

<!-- XXX replace d6 with _.random once we have underscore 1.4.2 -->

```js
// Support for playing D&D: Roll 3d6 for dexterity
Accounts.onCreateUser(function(options, user) {
  var d6 = function () { return Math.floor(Random.fraction() * 6) + 1; };
  user.dexterity = d6() + d6() + d6();
  // We still want the default hook's 'profile' behavior.
  if (options.profile)
    user.profile = options.profile;
  return user;
});
```

{% apibox "AccountsServer#validateLoginAttempt" %}

Call `validateLoginAttempt` with a callback to be called on login
attempts.  It returns an object with a single method, `stop`.  Calling
`stop()` unregisters the callback.

When a login attempt is made, the registered validate login callbacks
are called with a single argument, the attempt info object:

<dl class="objdesc">
{% dtdd name:"type" type:"String" %}
  The service name, such as "password" or "twitter".
{% enddtdd %}

{% dtdd name:"allowed" type:"Boolean" %}
  Whether this login is allowed and will be successful (if not aborted
  by any of the validateLoginAttempt callbacks).  False if the login
  will not succeed (for example, an invalid password or the login was
  aborted by a previous validateLoginAttempt callback).
{% enddtdd %}

{% dtdd name:"error" type:"Exception" %}
  When `allowed` is false, the exception describing why the login
  failed.  It will be a `Meteor.Error` for failures reported to the
  user (such as invalid password), and can be a another kind of
  exception for internal errors.
{% enddtdd %}

{% dtdd name:"user" type:"Object" %}
  When it is known which user was attempting to login, the Meteor user object.
  This will always be present for successful logins.
{% enddtdd %}

{% dtdd name:"connection" type:"Object" %}
  The `connection` object the request came in on. See
  [`Meteor.onConnection`](#meteor_onconnection) for details.
{% enddtdd %}

{% dtdd name:"methodName" type:"String" %}
  The name of the Meteor method being used to login.
{% enddtdd %}

{% dtdd name:"methodArguments" type:"Array" %}
  An array of the arguments passed to the login method.
{% enddtdd %}
</dl>

A validate login callback must return a truthy value for the login to
proceed.  If the callback returns a falsy value or throws an
exception, the login is aborted.  Throwing a `Meteor.Error` will
report the error reason to the user.

All registered validate login callbacks are called, even if one of the callbacks
aborts the login.  The later callbacks will see the `allowed` field set to
`false` since the login will now not be successful.  This allows later callbacks
to override an error from a previous callback; for example, you could override
the "Incorrect password" error with a different message.

Validate login callbacks that aren't explicitly trying to override a previous
error generally have no need to run if the attempt has already been determined
to fail, and should start with

```js
if (!attempt.allowed)
  return false;
```

<h2 id="accounts_rate_limit">Rate Limiting</h2>

By default, there are rules added to the [`DDPRateLimiter`](#ddpratelimiter)
that rate limit logins, new user registration and password reset calls to a
limit of 5 requests per 10 seconds per session. These are a basic solution
to dictionary attacks where a malicious user attempts to guess the passwords
of legitimate users by attempting all possible passwords.

These rate limiting rules can be removed by calling
`Accounts.removeDefaultRateLimit()`. Please see the
[`DDPRateLimiter`](#ddpratelimiter) docs for more information.
