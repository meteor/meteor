title: Passwords
description: Documentation of Meteor's password-based accounts API.
---

The `accounts-password` package contains a full system for password-based
authentication. In addition to the basic username and password-based
sign-in process, it also supports email-based sign-in including
address verification and password recovery emails.

The Meteor server stores passwords using the
[bcrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) algorithm. This helps
protect against embarrassing password leaks if the server's database is
compromised.

To add password support to your application, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
meteor add accounts-password
```

> In addition to configuring the [`email`](email.html) package's `MAIL_URL`, it is critical that you set proper values (specifically the `from` address) in [`Accounts.emailTemplates`](#Accounts-emailTemplates) to ensure proper delivery of e-mails!

You can construct your own user interface using the
functions below, or use the [`accounts-ui` package](#accountsui) to
include a turn-key user interface for password-based sign-in.

{% apibox "Accounts.createUser" %}

On the client, this function logs in as the newly created user on
successful completion. On the server, it returns the newly created user
id.

On the client, you must pass `password` and at least one of `username` or `email` &mdash; enough information for the user to be able to log in again later. If there are existing users with a username or email only differing in case, `createUser` will fail. The callback's `error.reason` will be `'Username already exists.'` or `'Email already exists.'` In the latter case, the user can then either [login](accounts.html#Meteor-loginWithPassword) or [reset their password](#Accounts-resetPassword).

On the server, you do not need to specify `password`, but the user will not be able to log in until it has a password (eg, set with [`Accounts.setPassword`](#accounts_setpassword)). To create an account without a password on the server and still let the user pick their own password, call `createUser` with the `email` option and then call [`Accounts.sendEnrollmentEmail`](#accounts_sendenrollmentemail). This will send the user an email with a link to set their initial password.

By default the `profile` option is added directly to the new user document. To
override this behavior, use [`Accounts.onCreateUser`](#accounts_oncreateuser).

This function is only used for creating users with passwords. The external
service login flows do not use this function.

Instead of modifying documents in the [`Meteor.users`](#meteor_users) collection
directly, use these convenience functions which correctly check for case
insensitive duplicates before updates.

{% apibox "Accounts.createUserVerifyingEmail" %}

{% apibox "Accounts.setUsername" %}

{% apibox "Accounts.addEmail" %}

By default, an email address is added with `{ verified: false }`. Use
[`Accounts.sendVerificationEmail`](#Accounts-sendVerificationEmail) to send an
email with a link the user can use to verify their email address.

{% apibox "Accounts.removeEmail" %}

{% apibox "Accounts.verifyEmail" %}

This function accepts tokens passed into the callback registered with
[`Accounts.onEmailVerificationLink`](#Accounts-onEmailVerificationLink).

{% apibox "Accounts.findUserByUsername" %}

{% apibox "Accounts.findUserByEmail" %}

Use the below functions to initiate password changes or resets from the server
or the client.

{% apibox "Accounts.changePassword" %}

{% apibox "Accounts.forgotPassword" %}

This triggers a call
to [`Accounts.sendResetPasswordEmail`](#accounts_sendresetpasswordemail)
on the server. When the user visits the link in this email, the callback
registered with [`Accounts.onResetPasswordLink`](#Accounts-onResetPasswordLink)
will be called.

If you are using the [`accounts-ui` package](#accountsui), this is handled
automatically. Otherwise, it is your responsibility to prompt the user for the
new password and call `resetPassword`.

{% apibox "Accounts.resetPassword" %}

This function accepts tokens passed into the callbacks registered with
[`AccountsClient#onResetPasswordLink`](#Accounts-onResetPasswordLink) and
[`Accounts.onEnrollmentLink`](#Accounts-onEnrollmentLink).

{% apibox "Accounts.setPassword" %}

{% apibox "Accounts.sendResetPasswordEmail" %}

When the user visits the link in this email, the callback registered with
[`AccountsClient#onResetPasswordLink`](#Accounts-onResetPasswordLink) will be called.

To customize the contents of the email, see
[`Accounts.emailTemplates`](#accounts_emailtemplates).

{% apibox "Accounts.sendEnrollmentEmail" %}

When the user visits the link in this email, the callback registered with
[`Accounts.onEnrollmentLink`](#Accounts-onEnrollmentLink) will be called.

To customize the contents of the email, see
[`Accounts.emailTemplates`](#accounts_emailtemplates).

{% apibox "Accounts.sendVerificationEmail" %}

When the user visits the link in this email, the callback registered with
[`Accounts.onEmailVerificationLink`](#Accounts-onEmailVerificationLink) will
be called.

To customize the contents of the email, see
[`Accounts.emailTemplates`](#accounts_emailtemplates).


{% apibox "Accounts.onResetPasswordLink" %}

{% apibox "Accounts.onEnrollmentLink" %}

{% apibox "Accounts.onEmailVerificationLink" %}

{% apibox "Accounts.emailTemplates" %}

This is an `Object` with several fields that are used to generate text/html
for the emails sent by `sendResetPasswordEmail`, `sendEnrollmentEmail`,
and `sendVerificationEmail`.

Set the fields of the object by assigning to them:

- `from`: (**required**) A `String` with an [RFC5322](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322) From
   address. By default, the email is sent from `no-reply@example.com`. **If you
   want e-mails to send correctly, this should be changed to your own domain
   as most e-mail providers will reject mail sent from `example.com`.**
- `siteName`: The public name of your application. Defaults to the DNS name of
   the application (eg: `awesome.meteor.com`).
- `headers`: An `Object` for custom email headers as described in
    [`Email.send`](#email_send).
- `resetPassword`: An `Object` with the fields:
 - `from`: A `Function` used to override the `from` address defined
   by the `emailTemplates.from` field.
 - `subject`: A `Function` that takes a user object and returns
   a `String` for the subject line of a reset password email.
 - `text`: An optional `Function` that takes a user object and a url, and
   returns the body text for a reset password email.
 - `html`: An optional `Function` that takes a user object and a
   url, and returns the body html for a reset password email.
- `enrollAccount`: Same as `resetPassword`, but for initial password setup for
   new accounts.
- `verifyEmail`: Same as `resetPassword`, but for verifying the users email
   address.

Example:

```js
Accounts.emailTemplates.siteName = 'AwesomeSite';
Accounts.emailTemplates.from = 'AwesomeSite Admin <accounts@example.com>';

Accounts.emailTemplates.enrollAccount.subject = (user) => {
  return `Welcome to Awesome Town, ${user.profile.name}`;
};

Accounts.emailTemplates.enrollAccount.text = (user, url) => {
  return 'You have been selected to participate in building a better future!'
    + ' To activate your account, simply click the link below:\n\n'
    + url;
};

Accounts.emailTemplates.resetPassword.from = () => {
  // Overrides the value set in `Accounts.emailTemplates.from` when resetting
  // passwords.
  return 'AwesomeSite Password Reset <no-reply@example.com>';
};
Accounts.emailTemplates.verifyEmail = {
   subject() {
      return "Activate your account now!";
   },
   text(user, url) {
      return `Hey ${user}! Verify your e-mail by following this link: ${url}`;
   }
};
```
