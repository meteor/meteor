> **Note:** Dynamic imports require Meteor 1.5 or higher.

The `dynamic-import` package provides an implementation of
`Module.prototype.dynamicImport`, an extension of the module runtime which
powers the [dynamic `import(...)`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import)
statement, an up-and-coming (ECMA2020) addition to the
ECMAScript standard.

The dynamic `import(...)` statement is a complementary method to the static
`import` technique of requiring a module.  While a statically <nobr>`import`-ed
</nobr>module would be bundled into the initial JavaScript bundle, a
dynamically <nobr>`import()`-ed</nobr> module is fetched from the server at
runtime.

Once a module is fetched dynamically from the server, it is cached permanently
on the client and additional requests for the same version of the module will
not incur the round-trip request to the server. If the module is changed then a
fresh copy will always be retrieved from the server.

## Usage

The `import(...)` statement returns a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises)
which is resolved with the `exports` of the module when it has been successfully
fetched from the server and is ready to be used.

Because it's a `Promise`, there are a couple methods developers can use to
dictate what will happen upon the availability of the dynamically loaded module:

### The `.then()` method of the `Promise`

```js
import("tool").then(tool => tool.task());
```

### By `await`-ing in an asynchronous function

Meteor supports [`async` and `await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function),
which provide a straightforward approach to asynchronously wait for the
module to be ready without the need to provide a callback:

```js
async function performTask() {
  const tool = await import("tool");
  tool.task();
}
```
{% blockquote %}
**Default exports**

The `import(...)` `Promise` is resolved with the `exports` of the module.
If it's necessary to use the "default" export from a module, it will be
available on the `default` property of the resulting object.  In the above
examples, this means it will be available as `tool.default`.  It can be
helpful to use parameter de-structuring to provide additional clarity:

```js
import("another-tool").then(({ default: thatTool }) => thatTool.go());
```
{% endblockquote %}

### Using `import()` with dynamic expressions

If you try to import using any computed expression, such as:

```js
let path = 'example';
const module = await import(`/libs/${path}.js`);
```

You'll get an error like so:

```js
Error: Cannot find module '/libs/example.js'
```

Meteorâ€™s build process builds a graph of all files that are imported or required
using static analysis. It then creates exact bundles of the referenced files
and makes them available to the client for `import()`.

Without a complete import statement (static, dynamic or `require`), Meteor won't
make that module available for `import()`.

The solution to make dynamic expressions work is to create a module "whitelist"
that can be read by the build process, but does not actually run. For example:

```js
if (false) {
  import("/libs/example.js");
  import("/libs/another-example.js");
  import("/libs/yet-another-example.js");
}
```

Make sure the whitelist is imported from both the client and server entry points.

## Difference to other bundling systems

In Meteor's implementation, the client has perfect information about which
modules were in the initial bundle, which modules are in the local cache, and
which modules still need to be fetched. There is never any overlap between
requests made by a single client, nor will there be any unneeded modules in the
response from the server. You might call this strategy **exact code splitting**,
to differentiate it from bundling.

Moreover, the initial bundle includes the hashes of all available dynamic
modules, so the client doesn't have to ask the server if it can use a cached
version of a module, and the same version of the module never needs to be
downloaded again by the same client. This caching system has all the benefits of
immutable caching.

Meteor also allows dynamic expressions as long as the dependency is expressed
statically somewhere else in your code. This is possible because Meteor's
client-side module system understands how to resolve dynamic strings at runtime
(which is not true in webpack or browserify, because they replace module
identifier strings with numbers). However, the set of available modules is
constrained by the string literals that you, the programmer, explicitly decided
to allow to be imported (either directly or in a whitelist).
