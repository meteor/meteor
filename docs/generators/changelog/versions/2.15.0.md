#### Migration Steps

In development, if you're using Linux, you might get an error like `version GLIBCXX_3.4.26 not found` or something related to g++.

This is related to your g++ version. With MongoDB 7, you need to have g++ 11 or higher. So make sure to have this updated.

This will happen only if you are trying to run your Meteor application with a MongoDB 7 version. If you run your app with a MONGO_URL pointing to a different MongoDB version, you won't have this issue. 

```bash

meteor update --release 2.15

```
