/**
 * @summary
 * Add a rule that matches against a stream of events describing method or
 * subscription attempts. Each event is an object with the following
 * properties:
 *
 * - `type`: Either "method" or "subscription"
 * - `name`: The name of the method or subscription being called
 * - `userId`: The user ID attempting the method or subscription
 * - `connectionId`: A string representing the user's DDP connection
 * - `clientAddress`: The IP address of the user
 *
 * Returns unique `ruleId` that can be passed to `removeRule`.
 *
 * @param {Object} matcher
 *   Matchers specify which events are counted towards a rate limit. A matcher
 *   is an object that has a subset of the same properties as the event objects
 *   described above. Each value in a matcher object is one of the following:
 *
 *   - a string: for the event to satisfy the matcher, this value must be equal
 *   to the value of the same property in the event object
 *
 *   - a function: for the event to satisfy the matcher, the function must
 *   evaluate to true when passed the value of the same property
 *   in the event object
 *
 * Here's how events are counted: Each event that satisfies the matcher's
 * filter is mapped to a bucket. Buckets are uniquely determined by the
 * event object's values for all properties present in both the matcher and
 * event objects.
 *
 * @param {number} numRequests  number of requests allowed per time interval.
 * Default = 10.
 * @param {number} timeInterval time interval in milliseconds after which
 * rule's counters are reset. Default = 1000.
