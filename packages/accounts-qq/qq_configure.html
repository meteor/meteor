    </li>
    <li>
      Input your host URL and follow the instructions to validate that domain. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Select application type as 'website'(网站)
    </li>
    <li>
      Set OAuth2.0 authorized callback page (授权回调页) to: <span class="url">{{siteUrl}}_oauth/qq?close</span>
      <small>Please note that tencent does not support localhost so you would have to provide a real hostname. 
        Also make sure you set up ROOT_URL for absolute url package to work correctly.</small>
