[Source code of released version](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/master/packages/mobile-experience) | [Source code of development version](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/devel/packages/mobile-experience)
***

A set of Cordova/PhoneGap-specific packages that set some good defaults when building for mobile. These packages only activate when you are building a native Android or iOS app.

1. [mobile-status-bar](https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/mobile-status-bar) - avoid the status bar information covering up your app content
2. [launch-screen](https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/launch-screen) - cover the app with a launch image so that people donâ€™t have to see things loading
