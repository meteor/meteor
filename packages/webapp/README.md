# webapp

The `webapp` package contains the core functionality that makes a
Meteor project into a web application. It is a "value added HTTP
server" that includes not just a web server, but also advanced app
serving functionality like over-the-air mobile app updates and HTML5
Appcache support. For more information, see the [Webapp project
page](https://www.meteor.com/webapp).
