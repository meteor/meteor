// WARNING:
// This will remove the configured socket file without warning. If
// the configured socket file is already in use by another application,
// it will still be removed. Node does not provide a reliable way to
// differentiate between a socket file that is already in use by
// another application or a stale socket file that has been
// left over after a SIGKILL. Since we have no reliable way to
// differentiate between these two scenarios, the best course of
// action during startup is to remove any existing socket file. This
// is not the safest course of action as removing the existing socket
// file could impact an application using it, but this approach helps
// ensure the HTTP server can startup without manual
// intervention (e.g. asking for the verification and cleanup of socket
// files before allowing the HTTP server to be started).
//
// The above being said, as long as the socket file path is
// configured carefully when the application is deployed (and extra
// care is taken to make sure the configured path is unique and doesn't
// conflict with another socket file path), then there should not be
// any issues with this approach.
