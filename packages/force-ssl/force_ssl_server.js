// NOTE: this doesn't handle websockets!

// Websockets come in via the 'upgrade' request. We can override this,
// however the problem is we're not sure if the websocket is actually
// encrypted. We don't get x-forwarded-for or x-forwarded-proto on
// websockets. It's possible the 'sec-websocket-origin' header does
// what we want, but that's not clear.
//
// For now, this package allows raw unencrypted DDP connections over
// websockets.
