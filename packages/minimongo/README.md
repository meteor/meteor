# minimongo

`minimongo` is reimplementation of (almost) the entire MongoDB API, against an
in-memory JavaScript database. It is like a MongoDB emulator that runs inside
your web browser. You can insert data into it and search, sort, and update that
data. This is great if you like the MongoDB API (which you may already be using
on the server), need a way to store data on the client that you've fetched and
are using to render your interface, and want to use that familiar API.

Minimongo is used as a temporary data cache in the standard Meteor stack, to
learn more about mini-databases and what they can do, see [the project page on
www.meteor.com](https://www.meteor.com/mini-databases)
