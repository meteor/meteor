/**
 * ## [new] Blaze.ReactiveVar(initialValue, [equalsFunc])
 *
 * A ReactiveVar holds a single value that can be get and set,
 * such that calling `set` will invalidate any Computations that
 * called `get`, according to the usual contract for reactive
 * data sources.
 *
 * A ReactiveVar is much like a Session variable -- compare `foo.get()`
 * to `Session.get("foo")` -- but it doesn't have a global name and isn't
 * automatically migrated across hot code pushes.  Also, while Session
 * variables can only hold JSON or EJSON, ReactiveVars can hold any value.
 *
 * An important property of ReactiveVars, which is sometimes the reason
 * to use one, is that setting the value to the same value as before has
 * no effect, meaning ReactiveVars can be used to absorb extra
 * invalidations that wouldn't serve a purpose.  However, by default,
 * ReactiveVars are extremely conservative about what changes they
 * absorb.  Calling `set` with an object argument will *always* trigger
 * invalidations, because even if the new value is `===` the old value,
 * the object may have been mutated.  You can change the default behavior
 * by passing a function of two arguments, `oldValue` and `newValue`,
 * to the constructor as `equalsFunc`.
 *
 * This class is extremely basic right now, but the idea is to evolve
 * it into the ReactiveVar of Geoff's Lickable Forms proposal.
