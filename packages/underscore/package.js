  // XXX Now the *.js handler is intrinsic rather than coming from the
  // 'meteor' package and we could remove this (if we provided a way
  // to let the package opt to not depend on 'meteor'.) We could even
  // remove unordered dependency support, though I think it's worth keeping
  // around for now to keep the possibility of dependency
  // configuration alive in the codebase.
