  // an undocumented API to allow 'meteor' to after us even though we
  // depend on it. This is necessary since 'meteor' depends on us. One
  // day we will avoid this problem by refactor, but for now this is a
  // practical and expedient solution.
  //
  // XXX Now the *.js handler is intrinsic rather than coming from the
  // 'meteor' package and we could remove this (if we provided a way
  // to let the package opt to not depend on 'meteor'.) We could even
  // remove unordered dependency support, though I think it's worth keeping
  // around for now to keep the possibility of dependency
  // configuration alive in the codebase.

  // objects, arrays, and array-like objects (such as the querySelectorAll

  // numeric length field whose constructor === Object are still treated as
  // objects, not as arrays.  Search for looksLikeArray.
