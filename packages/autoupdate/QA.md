# QA Notes
## Hot Code Push Reload

Run the leaderboard example, and click on one of the names.  Make a
change to the leaderboard.html file, see the client reload, and see
that the name is still selected.


## AUTOUPDATE_VERSION

Set the `AUTOUPDATE_VERSION` environment variable when running the
application:

    $ AUTOUPDATE_VERSION=abc meteor

Now when you make an HTML change, it won't appear in the client
automatically.  (Note the leader list flickers when the server
subscription restarts, but that's not a window reload).

Conversely, you can force a client reload (even without making any
client code changes) by restarting the server with a new value for
`AUTOUPDATE_VERSION`.


## No Client Reload on Server-only Change

Revert previous changes and run the example without setting
AUTOUPDATE_VERSION.

Note that it might look like the browser is reloading because the page
content in the leaderboard example will flicker when the server
restarts because the example is using autopublish, but that the window
won't actually be reloading.

In the browser console, assign a variable such as `a = true` so that
you can easily verify that the client hasn't reloaded.

In the leaderboard example directory, create the `server` directory
and add `foo.js`.  See in the browser console that `a` is still
defined, indicating the browser hasn't reloaded.


## Test with the appcache

Add the appcache package:

    $ meteor add appcache

And do the above tests again.

Note that if 1) AUTOUPDATE_VERSION is set so the client doesn't
automatically reload, 2) you make a client change, and 3) you manually
reload the browser page, you usually *won't* see the updated HTML the
*first* time you reload (unless the browser happened to check the app
cache manifest between steps 2 and 3).  This is normal browser app
cache behavior: the browser populates the app cache in the background,
so it doesn't wait for new files to download before displaying the web
page.


## Autoupdate.newClientAvailable

Undo previous changes made, such as by using `git checkout .` Reload
the client, which will cause the browser to stop using the app cache.

It's hard to see the `newClientAvailable` reactive variable when the
client automatically reloads.  Remove the `reload` package so you can
see the variable without having the client also reload.

    $ meteor remove meteor-platform
    $ meteor add meteor webapp logging tracker session ddp
    $ meteor add mongo templating handlebars check underscore
    $ meteor add jquery random ejson autoupdate spacebars

Add to leaderboard.js:

    Template.leaderboard.helpers({
      available: function () {
        return Autoupdate.newClientAvailable().toString();
      }
    });

And add `{{available}}` to the leaderboard template in
leaderboard.html.

Initially you'll see `false`, and then when you make a change to the
leaderboard HTML you'll see the variable change to `true`.  (You won't
see the new HTML on the client because you disabled reload).

Amusingly, you can undo the addition you made to the HTML and the "new
client available" variable will go back to `false` (you now don't have
client code available on the server different than what's running in
the browser), because by default the client version is based on a hash
of the client files.


## DDP Version Negotiation Failure

A quick way to test DDP version negotiation failure is to force the
client to use the wrong DDP version.  At the top of
livedata_connection.js:

     var Connection = function (url, options) {
        var self = this;
    +   options.supportedDDPVersions = ['abc'];

You will see the client reload (in the hope that new client code will
be available that can successfully negotiation the DDP version).  Each
reload takes longer than the one before, using an exponential backoff.

If you remove the `options.supportedDDPVersions` line and allow the
client to connect (or manually reload the browser page so you don't
have to wait), this will reset the exponential backoff counter.

You can verify the counter was reset by adding the line back in a
second time, and you'll see the reload cycle start over again with
first reloading quickly, and then again taking longer between tries.
