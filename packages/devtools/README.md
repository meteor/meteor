# Devtools

A set of tools that improve the developer experience. These tools wonâ€™t be included in production builds of your app.

1. [`hot-code-push`](https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/hot-code-push) - Refresh the client automatically when the server has new code.
2. [simple:dev-error-overlay](https://atmospherejs.com/simple/dev-error-overlay) - Display a nice overlay in your browser when your Meteor app has a server-side build error. You can also optionally display a desktop notification or play a sound!
