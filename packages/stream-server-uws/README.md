# Meteor's DDP stream server based on uWS

## Installation
    
1. Pin the older version of the `socket-stream-client` package,
for using native WebSocket instead of SockJS:

    ```bash
    meteor add socket-stream-client@=0.2.1
    ```

2. Install the `stream-server-uws` package:

    ```bash
    meteor add stream-server-uws
    ```

## Have fun
