# meteor-platform

This package is added to every app by `meteor create`. It includes a set of common packages that most Meteor apps will find useful, such as `webapp`, `tracker`, `session`, `ddp`, `mongo` and `blaze`. From the command line, you can run `meteor show meteor-platform` to see the full list of implied packages.

These packages make up the official [Meteor Platform](https://www.meteor.com/projects). See the README of each individual package to learn more about it.

This package was previously known as [standard-app-packages](https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/standard-app-packages).
