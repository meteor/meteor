[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is a fast and concise JavaScript
Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling,
animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development.

The `jquery` package adds the jQuery library to the client JavaScript
bundle. It has no effect on the server.

This package is automatically included in every new Meteor app by `meteor create`.

In addition to the `jquery` package, Meteor provides several jQuery
plugins as separate packages. These include:

* [`jquery-waypoints`](http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/)
