## Using this package on Windows

This package uses the [node-aes-gcm](https://github.com/xorbit/node-aes-gcm) NPM module, which requires you to have OpenSSL installed on your system to run. To install OpenSSL on Windows, use one of the binaries on [this page](http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html). Don't forget to install the Visual Studio 2008 redistributables if you don't have them yet.
