/**
 * This code does _NOT_ support hot (session-restoring) reloads on
 * IE6,7. It only works on browsers with sessionStorage support.
 *
 * There are a couple approaches to add IE6,7 support:
 *
 * - use IE's "userData" mechanism in combination with window.name.
 * This mostly works, however the problem is that it can not get to the
 * data until after DOMReady. This is a problem for us since this API
 * relies on the data being ready before API users run. We could
 * refactor using Meteor.startup in all API users, but that might slow
 * page loads as we couldn't start the stream until after DOMReady.
 * Here are some resources on this approach:
 * https://github.com/hugeinc/USTORE.js
 * http://thudjs.tumblr.com/post/419577524/localstorage-userdata
 * http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/domstorage2.shtml
 *
 * - POST the data to the server, and have the server send it back on
 * page load. This is nice because it sidesteps all the local storage
 * compatibility issues, however it is kinda tricky. We can use a unique
 * token in the URL, then get rid of it with HTML5 pushstate, but that
 * only works on pushstate browsers.
 *
 * This will all need to be reworked entirely when we add server-side
 * HTML rendering. In that case, the server will need to have access to
 * the client's session to render properly.
