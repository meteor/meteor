## `underscore`

[Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) is a utility-belt library for 
JavaScript that provides support for functional programming. It is 
invaluable for writing clear, concise JavaScript in a functional style.

The `underscore` package defines the `_` namespace on both the client
and the server.


{{#warning}}
Currently, underscore is included in all projects, as the Meteor
core depends on it. _ is available in the global namespace on both the
client and the server even if you do not include this package. However
if you do use underscore in your application, you should still add the
package as we will remove the default underscore in the future.

{{#warning}}
We have slightly modified the way Underscore differentiates between
objects and arrays in [collection functions](http://underscorejs.org/#each).
The original Underscore logic is to treat any object with a numeric `length`
property as an array (which helps it work properly on
[`NodeList`s](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList)).
In Meteor's version of Underscore, objects with a numeric `length` property
are treated as objects if they have no prototype (specifically, if
`x.constructor === Object`.
