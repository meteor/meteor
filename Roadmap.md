# Meteor Roadmap

**Up to date as of Jan 20, 2021**

This document describes the high-level features and actions for the Meteor project in the near- to medium-term future. This roadmap was built based on community feedback and to improve areas where Meteor is already strong. The description of many items include sentences and ideas from Meteor community members.

As with any roadmap, this is a living document that will evolve as priorities and dependencies shift; we aim to update the roadmap with any changes or status updates every quarter.

Contributors are encouraged to focus their efforts on work that aligns with the roadmap then we can work together in these areas.

PRs to the roadmap are welcome. If you are willing to contribute please open a PR explaining your ideas and what you would be able to do yourself.

## Priorities for V2

Updated at: 2021/01/20

V2 initial release (2.0) was delivered today (2021/01/20) with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), React Fast Refresh, and Free deploy including MongoDB on [Cloud](https://www.meteor.com/cloud) and some other features. See all the changes [here](./History.md). 

We expect to have HMR also working for Blaze in Meteor 2.1 in the following weeks (it's currently on [beta](https://github.com/meteor/blaze/pull/313)).

Other important updates that you should expect to see in Meteor 2.2, 2.3 and so on:
- Node.js 14; [PR](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/11197)
- Cordova 10; [PR](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/11208)
- Remove deprecated code pre v1; [PR](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/11226)
- Tree-shaking; [PR](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/11164)
- Blaze HMR; [PR](https://github.com/meteor/blaze/pull/313)
- Tutorials migration (help needed, understand [here](https://forums.meteor.com/t/new-meteor-react-tutorial-and-new-format-for-tutorials/54074));

Do you want to get involved in the items above? Talk to [Filipe Névola](https://twitter.com/filipenevola) in the [community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/meteor-community/shared_invite/enQtODA0NTU2Nzk5MTA3LWY5NGMxMWRjZDgzYWMyMTEyYTQ3MTcwZmU2YjM5MTY3MjJkZjQ0NWRjOGZlYmIxZjFlYTA5Mjg4OTk3ODRiOTc)

V2 minor releases are not limited by the items above, these are the ones already in progress, some of them are going to be ready in the next weeks.

## Priorities for V3

Updated at: 2021/01/20

Meteor is accelerating! We are going release more often this year.

We expect to have new features focusing in ease app development in V3 or probably in V2 as well, the first step is to review our [feature requests](https://github.com/meteor/meteor-feature-requests) one more time and define new priorities.

Maybe we should also have a new way of prioritization for new features, right now this [repository]((https://github.com/meteor/meteor-feature-requests)) with issues is not good enough in our opinion, the plan is to be even more open for feedbacks and collaboration. If we make changes in this process we are going to announce in the [Forums](https://forums.meteor.com/) and Slack as always.

> We are also looking for new developers to be part of our core team and of course if you are already contributing to Meteor you have a head start.
> 
> We don't have an official position description yet but again, contributing to Meteor in the open-source is the best way to join the core team.

Maybe you are asking: Why the format of this Roadmap was changed in this update?

We believe the items here were in some part outdated so we want to have a "fresh start". You should expect a new list of items here soon. It doesn't mean that all the old items are out of question, or they aren't important, probably the opposite and you will see most of them again here soon.
