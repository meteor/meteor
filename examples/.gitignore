# Each individual example should include 'local' in foo/.meteor/.gitignore.
# However, we also include this top-level .gitignore so that the following
# situation:
#    $ git checkout some-branch-with-a-new-example
#    $ (cd examples/unfinished/new-example; meteor)
#    $ git checkout devel
# doesn't leave you with tons of files in
# examples/unfinished/new-example/.meteor/local showing up in your 'git status'.
