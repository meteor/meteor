Just use commands like 'meteor add\n   <packagename>', 'meteor publish', and 'meteor search <query>'.\n\n   This release is being downloaded in the background. It's a big\n   change! Once it's done downloading, then the next time you run\n   'meteor', your Meteor install will be automatically upgraded to the\n   new system. The upgrade will take a few minutes and as part of it\n   old versions of Meteor will be removed from your machine. These old\n   versions will be automatically redownloaded using the new system if\n   you work on apps that use them.\n"
