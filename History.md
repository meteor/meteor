## vNEXT

## v0.4.0

* Merge Spark, a new live page update engine
  * Breaking API changes
    * Input elements no longer preserved based on `id` and `name` attributes. Use [`preserve`](http://docs.meteor.com/#template_preserve) instead.

    * All `Meteor.ui` functions removed. Use `Meteor.render`, `Meteor.renderList`, and [Spark](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Spark) functions instead.

    * New template functions (eg. `created`, `rendered`, etc) may collide with existing helpers. Use `Template.foo.helpers()` to avoid conflicts.

    * New syntax for declaring event maps. Use `Template.foo.events({...})`. For backwards compatibility, both syntaxes are allowed for now.

  * New Template features

    * Allow embedding non-Meteor widgets (eg. Google Maps) using [`{{#constant}}`](http://docs.meteor.com/#constant)

    * Callbacks when templates are rendered. See http://docs.meteor.com/#template_rendered

    * Explicit control of which nodes are preserved during re-rendering. See http://docs.meteor.com/#template_preserve
