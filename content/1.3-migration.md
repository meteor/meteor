title: Migrating to 1.3
order: 20
description: How to migrate your application to use recommended best practice as of Meteor 1.3.
---

**NOTE**: this document is a work in progress and is not final. We aim to keep it up to date with the latest beta of the 1.3 release, which as of this writing is `1.3-beta.11`.

To update your app to this beta, type `meteor update --release 1.3-beta.11`.

Note in particular that many links below point to unfinished guide articles.

<h2 id="breaking-changes">Breaking changes</h2>

These are all the *breaking changes* -- that is changes that you absolutely have to worry about if you are updating your app from 1.2.x to 1.3. However, we recommend that you also consider the *recommended* changes listed in the other sections below.

 - Files in a directory named `imports/` will no longer load eagerly. (You should probably rename such a directory as it the basis of our new [module system](#modules)).

 - Files within your app named `test[s]*` or `*.test[s].*` will no longer load eagerly (you should probably rename such a file if it doesn't contain tests, as it will be eagerly loaded by our new [app testing modes](#testing)).

<h3 id="breaking-changes-mobile">Mobile</h3>

- iOS apps now require iOS 8 or higher, and building for iOS requires Xcode 7.2 to be installed.

- Building for Android now requires Android SDK 23 to be installed. You may also need to create a new AVD for the emulator.

- Cordova has been upgraded to the most recent versions (Cordova 6.0.0, Cordova iOS 4.0.1 and Cordova Android 5.1.0). This may require you to upgrade your plugin versions. We pin core Cordova plugins to versions known to be compatible and warn about this during build, but you may encounter compile time or runtime errors with third party plugins. Upgrading to newer versions of these plugins may help if they have been updated to work with recent versions of Cordova.

- Some low resolution app icon and launch images sizes for now unsupported devices have been deprecated. To avoid a deprecation warning during build, please remove the entries from your `mobile-config.js`. (You probably also want to remove the image files from your project.)

- When opening the generated project with `meteor run ios-device`, Xcode will show a dialog asking whether to 'Convert to Latest Swift Syntax'. Make sure to click 'cancel' here, because this conversion will leave the code in an invalid state (this seems to be an Xcode bug).

- The plugin used to serve your app's files and support hot code push has been completely rewritten. As a result, files are now served from `localhost` instead of `meteor.local`, with a fixed port number derived from your `appId`. You may have to update OAuth redirect URLs to point to the new local domain and port.

- The plugin now allows for local file access on both iOS and Android. You can construct file system URLs manually (`http://localhost:<port>/local-filesystem/<path>`) or use `WebAppLocalServer.localFileSystemUrl()` to convert a `file://` URL. On iOS, core plugins like `cordova-plugin-file` and `cordova-plugin-camera` (using `Camera.DestinationType.FILE_URI`) will now automatically return these URLs instead of `file://` URLs.

<h2 id="modules">Recommended changes: use modules</h2>

The biggest new feature in Meteor 1.3 is support for [ES2015 modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/import) on the client and the server. Using modules you can declare dependencies between files, control load order, and use NPM packages on the client and server easily.

You should load all Meteor "psuedo-globals" using the `import { Name } from 'meteor/package' syntax. For instance:

```js
import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';
import { EJSON } from 'meteor/ejson';
```

If you are using app-local packages to control load order and write unit tests for your application, we recommend you switch to using modules. You can read about our recommended structure for applications and modules in the [Application Structure article](https://github.com/meteor/guide/blob/structure-content/content/structure.md) of the Meteor Guide, and how to test them in the [Testing article](https://github.com/meteor/guide/blob/testing-modules-content/content/testing.md).

If you are using Atmosphere packages which simply wrap NPM packages, both on the client and server, it is now recommended that you simply install them using NPM. Run `npm init` to initialize your `package.json` and install packages with `npm install --save` (or `npm install --save-dev` if it's development dependency for testing etc.). We have [some tips](https://github.com/meteor/guide/blob/package-content/content/packages.md#converting-between-callbacks-and-fibers) about how to use NPM packages written in an asyncronous style.

Also, you should no longer need to use the [`meteorhacks:npm`](https://atmospherejs.com/meteorhacks/npm) package.

<h2 id="packages">Recommended changes: package authors</h2>

Package authors are recommended to:

  - No longer publish wrapper packages that do no more than include an NPM package / client side lib. If your package adds significant wrappers around the NPM package, it might make sense however.

  - Publish to NPM when appropriate, especially if your package can be used by the wider JS community!

  - Use [`api.mainModule()`](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/release-1.3/packages/modules/README.md#modular-package-structure) and `export` from your main module rather than `api.exports()` in Atmosphere packages.

  - If you depend (directly or transitively) on a client side NPM package that is large or problematic if installed twice (e.g. React), use [`tmeasday:check-npm-versions`](https://github.com/tmeasday/check-npm-versions) (XXX: not yet published) to declare "peer" dependencies.

<h2 id="testing">Recommended changes: Testing</h2>

Meteor 1.3 includes a new command `meteor test-app`, which can be used to run tests against your app, in two modalities. You can read about these features in much more detail in the [Testing Guide Article](https://github.com/meteor/guide/blob/testing-modules-content/content/testing.md).

<h3 id="integration-testing">Integration testing</h3>

If you were previously using [Velocity](http://velocity.meteor.com) to run tests against your running Meteor app, the integration test mode should allow you to run your tests against 1.3, with some small changes.

To convert tests, you'll need to change or upgrade your test driver package to a 1.3 conformant package (as of this writing there is only one choice [`avital:mocha`](https://atmospherejs.com/avital/mocha) but we expect more to exist in the future). In your tests you should check that `Meteor.isIntegrationTest` is `true` and start your tests by running meteor test-app --integration`.

Note that integration test mode does not run the test reporter in a separate application to the app under test, and does not amalagamate results from multiple testing systems, as Velocity does. This effectively means if you are using more than one testing system, you will need to run `meteor test-app` multiple times.

Also, it means certain types of tests are better off written as *acceptance tests* outside of the Meteor tool (more to come on this).

<h3 id="unit-testing">Unit testing</h3>

If you were previously using in-app packages in order to unit test your app, you should switch to a [modules-based approach](#modules) and test them using the unit test mode.

To convert your unit tests to run against the app, first upgrade your test driver (see [above](#integration-testing)) and then place your test files alongside the modules they are testing with a name matching `*.tests.*`. Such files will automatically be added to your "unit test app" when you run `meteor test-app --unit`. You can check `Meteor.isUnitTest` to differentiate such tests from integration tests, and `import` the modules that you need to test against within each test file.

Some example tests can be seen the [Todos example app](https://github.com/meteor/todos)

**NOTE**: please disregard the below for now.

## Migrating to use imports everywhere

Never use a symbol without importing it (i.e. no more psuedo-globals!).

In general from core Meteor libraries your code should remain unchanged, and you just add some lines like:

```js
import {Meteor} from 'meteor/meteor';
import {ReactiveVar} from 'meteor/reactive-var';
```

With the following exceptions


1. Use `import {Collection, Cursor, ObjectID} from 'meteor/mongo'`

2. Use `import {MeteorServer} from 'meteor/ddp-server'` and call:
  1. `MeteorServer.publish()`
  2. `MeteorServer.methods()`

3. Use `import {MeteorConnection} from 'meteor/ddp-client'` and call:
  1. `MeteorConnection.apply()`
  1. `MeteorConnection.call()`
  1. `MeteorConnection.disconnect()`
  1. `MeteorConnection.onConnection()`
  1. `MeteorConnection.reconnect()`
  1. `MeteorConnection.status()`
  1. `MeteorConnection.subscribe()`

4. Use `import {connect} from 'meteor/ddp-client'` rather than `DDP.connect`;

5. Use `import {Accounts} from 'meteor/accounts-base'` and (on the client) use:
  1. `Accounts.user()` instead of `Meteor.currentUser()`
  2. `Accounts.userId()` instead of `Meteor.userId()`,
  3. `Accounts.loggingIn()` insead of `Meteor.loggingIn()`,
  4. `Accounts.logout()` instead of `Meteor.logout()`,
  5. `Accounts.logoutOtherClients()` instead of `Meteor.logoutOtherClient()`
  6. `Accounts.users` instead of `Meteor.users`
  
6. Use `import {AccountsPassword} from 'meteor/accounts-password'` and:
  1. On the client, call:
    1. `AccountsPassword.loginWithPassword()` instead of `Meteor.loginWithPassword()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.changePassword()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.createUser()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.forgotPassword()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.resetPassword()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.verifyEmai()`
  2. On the server, call:
    1. `AccountsPassword.findUserByEmail()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.findUserByUsername()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.onEmailVerificationLink()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.onEnrollmentLink()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.onResetPasswordLink()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.addEmail()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.removeEmail()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.sendEnrollmentEmail()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.sendResetPasswordEmail()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.sendVerificationEmail()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.setPassword()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.setUsername()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.createUser()`,
    1. `AccountsPassword.emailTemplate()`

7. Use `import {AccountsFacebook} from 'meteor/accounts-facebook'` and:
  1. `AccountsFacebook.loginWithFacebook()` rather than `Meteor.loginWithFacebook()`.

  XXX: not yet changed on the branch, in lieu of bikeshedding

8. Use `import {Template} from 'meteor/templating'` (gotcha)

9. Use `import {config} from 'meteor/accounts-ui-unstyled'`

10. Use `import {Computation, Dependency} from 'meteor/tracker'`
