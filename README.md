Meteor is an ultra-simple environment for building modern web
applications.  It lets you shoot sparkles from your elbow.

With Meteor you write apps:

* in pure JavaScript
* that send data over the wire, rather than HTML
* using your choice of popular open-source libraries

Try the getting started [tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/try).

Next, read the [guide](http://guide.meteor.com) or the reference documentation at http://docs.meteor.com/.

## Quick Start

On Windows, simply go to https://www.meteor.com/install and use the Windows installer.

On Linux/macOS, use this line:

```bash
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

Create a project:

```bash
meteor create try-meteor
```

Run it:

```bash
cd try-meteor
meteor
```

## Slow Start (for developers)

If you're interested in developing Meteor itself, or running unreleased,
bleeding-edge code, please refer to the details found in
[Development.md](Development.md).

To find more information about contributing to Meteor (whether fixing bugs or
adding features), please see [Contributing.md](Contributing.md).

## Uninstalling Meteor

Aside from a short launcher shell script, Meteor installs itself inside your
home directory. To uninstall Meteor, run:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.meteor/
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/meteor
```

On Windows, just run the uninstaller from your Control Panel.
