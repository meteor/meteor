Submitting a dummy pull request because there's no Issues tab.

So I landed on this repo after searching for "meteor windows" on GitHub. Figured out what the real repo was, but nevertheless, would be nice to [delete this repo](https://github.com/canoas/meteor-windows/admin) now that it's obsolete, so others end up in the correct place.
