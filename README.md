If you want to develop applications that are both modern and mobile, then Meteor should be your platform of choice. 

Meteor is essentially a full-stack (frontend plus backend) platform that is based on Javascript. 

At its core Meteor consists of multiple sets of technologies which can be used to rapidly build connected-client reactive applications. 
It can also be used a built tool. 

Moreover, Meteor also includes a selected set of packages from frameworks such as Node.js. 

On top of that, Meteor can leverage an extremely active Javascript community and never be short on solutions to any encountered problem during development. 

###Why Is Meteor Such An Effective Full-stack Development Platform?

There are a lot of reasons why you would want to use Meteor as your primary development platform.

With Meteor, you can take care of all of your frontend and backend needs with just one language. That language is Javascript. 

Javascript, when used on the Meteor platform, can handle all three environments including web browser, mobile device and application server. 

Meteor's strength lies in the simplicity of its development environment and the apps written using its technology stack.

Additionally, Meteor further simplifies the server-client reliationship by sending data, instead of HTML, over the wire.

In other words, using Meteor, you can write apps where the server sends data and the client renders it. 

Consider the fact that Javascropt has an extremely active community. There are literally hundreds of Javascript frameworks both for the frontend and the backend. 

Meteor simplifies the process of selection by offering the best that the Javascript community has to offer. 

Meteor's ecosystem consists of the most popular open-source Javascript libraries. 

Perhaps the biggest reason why Meteor saves so much development time and effort is because it offers full stack reactivity. 

To put it another way, Meteor allows your app's user interface to update itself to its latest state smoothly and continuously without much effort.

On a side note, remember that Meteor is not for beginner Javascript developers. The Meteor platform is aimed at intermediate developers who have some experience with Javascript and general web development.

## Uninstalling Meteor

Aside from a short launcher shell script, Meteor installs itself inside your
home directory. To uninstall Meteor, run:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.meteor/
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/meteor
```

On Windows, just run the uninstaller from your Control Panel.
