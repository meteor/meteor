# Meteor

Meteor is an ultra-simple environment for building modern web
applications.

With Meteor you write apps:

* in pure JavaScript
* that send data over the wire, rather than HTML
* using your choice of popular open-source libraries

Try the getting started [tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/try).

Next, read the [guide](http://guide.meteor.com) or the reference documentation at http://docs.meteor.com/.

## Quick Start

Install Meteor:

```bash
curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh
```

Create a project:

```bash
meteor create try-meteor
```

Run it:

```bash
cd try-meteor
meteor
```

## Slow Start (for developers)

If you want to run on the bleeding edge, or help develop Meteor, you
can run Meteor directly from a git checkout.

```bash
git clone git://github.com/meteor/meteor.git
cd meteor
```

If you're the sort of person who likes to build everything from scratch,
you can build all the Meteor dependencies (node.js, npm, mongodb, etc)
with the provided script. This requires git, a C and C++ compiler,
autotools, and scons. If you do not run this script, Meteor will
automatically download pre-compiled binaries when you first run it.

```bash
# OPTIONAL
./scripts/generate-dev-bundle.sh
```

Now you can run meteor directly from the checkout (if you did not
build the dependency bundle above, this will take a few moments to
download a pre-build version).

```bash
./meteor --help
```

From your checkout, you can read the docs locally. The `/docs` directory is a
meteor application, so simply change into the `/docs` directory and launch
the app:

```bash
cd docs/
../meteor
```

You'll then be able to read the docs locally in your browser at
`http://localhost:3000/`.

Note that if you run Meteor from a git checkout, you cannot pin apps to specific
Meteor releases or run using different Meteor releases using `--release`.

## Uninstalling Meteor

Aside from a short launcher shell script, Meteor installs itself inside your
home directory. To uninstall Meteor, run:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.meteor/
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/meteor
```
