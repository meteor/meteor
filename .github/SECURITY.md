# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Unless otherwise noted, MCP packages and projects support the latest version of Meteor.
As of the time of writing this in September 2023 it is Meteor 2.13 and, in general the 2.x series.
Support for Meteor 1.x is not guaranteed and at best can include Meteor 1.12.1.
At the present time, we are also preparing to support Meteor 3.0 which is in development.

| Meteor Version | Supported          |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| 3.0            | 🚧                 |
| > 2.0          | ✅                 |
| < 1.12         | ❌                 |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are not providing support for Meteor itself. See their [SECURITY](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/SECURITY.md) for more information.

Any security concerns should be first raised in the repository of the affected package.
If you want to report a vulnerability privately, please contact the maintainer of the package directly.
If you are not sure who that is, you can contact one of the following people, and they will take it from there:
