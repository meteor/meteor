Describe the big picture of your changes here about why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, link to that.

Note that we are unlikely to accept feature pull requests without prior discussion. Open an issue first and discuss your ideas there before implementing them.

Always follow the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/Contributing.md) when submitting a pull request. In particular, make sure existing tests still pass, and add tests for all new behavior. When fixing a bug, you may want to add a test to verify the fix.

## TODO:

* [ ] Solution confirmed on that issue
* [ ] New tests for new behavior
* [ ] `History.md` updated if need to be written down
