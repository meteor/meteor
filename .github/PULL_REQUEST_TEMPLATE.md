Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.

Note that we are unlikely to accept pull requests that add features without prior discussion. The best way to propose a feature is to open an issue first (in the [meteor/meteor-feature-requests](https://github.com/meteor/meteor-feature-requests/issues) repository) and discuss your ideas there before implementing them.

Always follow the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/Contributing.md) when submitting a pull request. In particular, make sure existing tests still pass, and add tests for all new behavior. When fixing a bug, you may want to add a test to verify the fix.
