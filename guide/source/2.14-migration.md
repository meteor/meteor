Most of the new features in Meteor 2.14 are either applied directly behind the
scenes (in a backwards compatible manner) or are opt-in. For a complete
breakdown of the changes, please refer to the [changelog](http://docs.meteor.com/changelog.html).


<h2 id="changes">Changes in Meteor 2.14</h2>

<h3 id="cordova">Cordova Package</h3>

Cordova has been updated to v12.0.1 for Android and v7.0.1 for iOS. This
requires a few changes to your Cordova project:

  - The `splash-screen` package has removed the the `cordova-plugin-splashscreen`
    is now on `cordova-android` core, so we have removed the dependency from the
    `splash-screen` package.
    As a result we are dropping the support for dark mode splash screen on Android.
    To create this now you need to create two themes on your `config.xml` file.
    You can follow in their [docs](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/core/features/splashscreen/index.html) how to update your splash screen


Your `.mobile-config.js` file should have the following preferences:

```js

App.setPreference('android-targetSdkVersion', '33')
App.setPreference('android-minSdkVersion', '28')

```
